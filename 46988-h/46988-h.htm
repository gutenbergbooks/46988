      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>F all the joyous
      sounds of all the year there is none more loved by Peter Rabbit, and the
      rest of us for that matter, than the soft whistle of Winsome Bluebird in
      the spring. The first time Peter hears it he always jumps up in the air,
      kicks his long heels together, and does a funny little dance of pure joy,
      for he knows that Winsome Bluebird is the herald of sweet Mistress Spring,
      and that she is not far behind him. It is the end of the shivery, sad time
      and the beginning of the happy, glad time, and Peter rejoices when he
      hears that sweet, soft voice which is sometimes so hard to locate, seeming
      to come from everywhere and nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Peter loves Winsome Bluebird and never tires of seeing him about. You
      know he wears a very, very beautiful coat of blue, the blue of the sky
      when it is softest, and you love to lie on your back and look up into it
      and dream and dream. It always has seemed to Peter that Winsome's coat is
      one of the loveliest he ever has seen, as indeed it is, and that it is
      quite right and proper and just as it should be that one having such a
      beautiful voice and bringing such a beautiful message should himself be
      beautiful. He said as much one day when he had run over to the Smiling
      Pool to pay his respects to Grandfather Frog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chug-a-rum! Certainly. Of course,&rdquo; replied Grandfather Frog. &ldquo;Winsome
      Bluebird has a beautiful nature and his beautiful coat is the reward which
      Old Mother Nature has given him. It has been in the family ever since his
      grandfather a thousand times removed was brave enough to become the herald
      of Mistress Spring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Grandfather Frog, that sounds like a story,&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;Please,
      please tell it to me, for I love Winsome Bluebird, and I know I shall love
      him more when I have learned more about him. His
      great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather must have done something very fine
      to have won such a lovely reward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did,&rdquo; replied Grandfather Frog. &ldquo;He became the herald of Mistress
      Spring when no one else would, and bravely carried his message of gladness
      and joy where it was sadly needed, in spite of cold and hardship which no
      one else was willing to face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, please tell me all about it,&rdquo; begged Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandfather Frog appeared to consider for a few minutes, and Peter waited
      anxiously. Then Grandfather Frog cleared his voice. &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said he,
      &ldquo;because you ought to know it. Everybody ought to know it, and Winsome
      Bluebird certainly never will tell it himself. He is too modest for that.
      It happened a great while ago when the world was young. Mr. Bluebird was
      one of the quietest and most modest of all the birds. He wore just a
      modest gray coat, and no one took any particular notice of him. In fact,
      he didn't even have a name. He never quarreled with his neighbors. He
      never was envious of those to whom Old Mother Nature had given beautiful
      coats, or if he were, he never showed it. He just minded his own affairs
      and did his best to do his share of the work of the Great World, for even
      in the beginning of things there was something for each one to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Mother Nature was very busy those days making the Great World a fit
      place in which to live, and as soon as she had started a new family of
      birds or animals she had to leave them to take care of themselves and get
      along as best they could. Those who were too lazy or too stupid to take
      care of themselves disappeared, and others took their places. There was
      nothing lazy or stupid about Mr. Bluebird, and he quickly learned how to
      take care of himself and at the same time to keep on the best of terms
      with his neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the place where the first birds lived became too crowded and old
      King Eagle led them out into the new land Old Mother Nature had been
      preparing for them, Mr. Bluebird was one of the first to follow him. The
      new land was very beautiful, and there was plenty of room and plenty to
      eat for all. Then came Jack Frost with snow and ice and drove all the
      birds back to the place they had come from. They made up their minds that
      they would stay there even if it were crowded. But after a while Old
      Mother Nature came to tell them that soon Jack Frost would be driven back
      from that wonderful new land, and sweet Mistress Spring would waken all
      the sleeping plants and all the sleeping insects up there so that it would
      be as beautiful as it was before, even more beautiful than the place where
      they were now. She said that she should expect them to go to the new land
      and make it joyous with their songs and build their homes there and help
      her to keep the insects and worms from eating all the green things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'But first I want a herald to go before Mistress Spring to tell those who
      have lived there all through the time of snow and ice that Mistress Spring
      is coming. Who will go as the herald of sweet Mistress Spring?' asked Old
      Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All the birds looked at one another and shivered, and then one by one
      they tried to slip out of sight. Now Mr. Bluebird had modestly waited for
      some of his big, strong neighbors to offer to take the message of gladness
      up into that frozen land, but when he saw them slip away one by one, his
      heart grew hot with shame for them, and he flew out before Old Mother
      Nature. 'I'll go,' said he, bobbing his head respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Mother Nature just had to smile, because compared with some of his
      neighbors Mr. Bluebird was so very small. 'What can such a little fellow
      as you do?' she asked. 'You will freeze to death up there, for it is still
      very cold.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If you please, I can at least try,' replied Mr. Bluebird modestly. 'If I
      find I can't go on, I can come back.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'And what reward do you expect?' asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'The joy of spreading such good news as the coming of Mistress Spring
      will be all the reward I want,' replied Mr. Bluebird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This reply so pleased Old Mother Nature that she then and there made Mr.
      Bluebird the herald of Mistress Spring and started him on his long
      journey. It <i>was</i> a long journey and a hard journey, harder, very
      much harder for Mr. Bluebird than the same journey is for Winsome these
      days. You see, everything was new to him. And then it was so cold! He
      couldn't get used to the cold. It seemed sometimes as if he certainly
      would freeze to death. At these times, when he sat shivering and shaking,
      he would remember that sweet Mistress Spring was not very far behind and
      that he was her herald. This would give him courage, and he would bravely
      keep on. Whenever he stopped to rest, he would whistle the news that
      Mistress Spring was coming, and sometimes, just to keep up his own
      courage, he would whistle while he was flying, and he found it helped. To
      keep warm at night he crept into hollow trees, and it was thus he learned
      how snug and safe and comfortable such places were, and he made up his
      mind that in just such a place he would build his nest when the time came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As he passed on he left behind him great joy, and Mistress Spring found
      as she journeyed north that all in the forests and on the meadows were
      eagerly awaiting her, for they had heard the message of her coming; and
      she was glad and told Old Mother Nature how well her herald had done his
      work. When he had completed his errand, Mr. Bluebird built a home and was
      as modest and retiring as ever. He didn't seem to think that he had done
      anything out of the usual. He simply rejoiced in his heart that he had
      been able to do what Old Mother Nature had requested, and it never entered
      his head that he should have any other reward than the knowledge that he
      had done his best and that he had brought cheer and hope to many.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Jack Frost moved down from the far North in the fall, all the birds
      journeyed south again, and of course Mr. Bluebird went with them. The next
      season when it was time for Mistress Spring to start north, Old Mother
      Nature assembled all the birds, and this time, instead of asking who would
      carry the message, she called Mr. Bluebird out before them and asked if he
      were willing to be the herald once more. Mr. Bluebird said that he would
      be glad to be the herald if she wished it. Then Old Mother Nature told all
      the birds how brave Mr. Bluebird was and how faithful and true, and she
      made all the other birds feel ashamed, especially those bigger and
      stronger than Mr. Bluebird. Then she said: 'Winsome Bluebird, for that is
      to be your name from now on, I here and now appoint you the herald of
      Mistress Spring, and the honor shall descend to your children and your
      children's children forever and ever, and you shall be one of the most
      loved of all the birds. And because you are a herald, you shall have a
      bright coat, as all heralds should have; and because you are true and
      faithful, your coat shall be blue, as blue as the blue of the sky.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She reached out and touched Mr. Bluebird, and sure enough his sober gray
      coat turned the most wonderful blue. Then once more he started on his long
      journey and he whistled his message more joyously than before. And because
      his whistle brought joy and gladness, and because he was beautiful to see,
      it came about just as Old Mother Nature had said it would, that he was one
      of the most loved of all the birds, even as his
      great-great-ever-so-great-grandson is to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter drew a long breath. &ldquo;Thank you, Grandfather Frog,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I have
      always loved Winsome Bluebird and now I shall love him more.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      II. WHEN OLD MR. GOPHER FIRST GOT POCKETS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE was one of
      Peter Rabbit's neighbors of whose presence he was always aware, and yet
      whom he almost never saw. No, it wasn't Miner the Mole, but it was one who
      lives in much the same way as Miner. When Peter would leave the dear Old
      Briar-patch he seldom went far without coming to a little pile of fresh
      earth. These little piles of earth had puzzled Peter a great deal for a
      long time. It sometimes seemed to Peter as if they appeared by magic. He
      would pass across a certain part of the Green Meadows, and there would be
      nothing but the green things growing there. When he returned the same way,
      there would be one or two or maybe half a dozen piles of newly turned
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Peter the first time he noticed one of these little
      earth piles, &ldquo;where there is a pile of earth like that, there must be a
      hole. Some one has been digging, and this is the dirt thrown out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when Peter looked for the hole he couldn't find one. There was no
      hole. It was very puzzling, but it was a fact. He kicked that pile of
      earth until he had scattered it far and wide, but there was no sign of a
      hole. Later he tried the same thing with other little piles of earth, but
      never once did he find a hole. It looked as if some one brought those
      little piles, dropped them on the Green Meadows, and then went away. Of
      course no one did anything of the kind, and Peter knew it. He spent a good
      deal of time wondering who could make them. Then one day, as he was
      hopping along across the Green Meadows, the ground right in front of him
      began to move. It so startled Peter that his first thought was to run.
      Then he decided that it would be foolish to run until there was something
      to run from. So he sat perfectly still and watched that spot where the
      ground was moving. Earth, loose earth, was pushed up from underneath, and
      even as Peter sat there staring, with eyes popping out of his head and
      mouth wide open in wonder, the pile grew and grew until it was as big as
      any of the piles about which he so often had wondered. Then suddenly a
      head was thrust out of the middle of it, a homely head. In an instant it
      vanished, and a second later the hole where it had been was filled. Peter
      could hear the stranger packing the earth in from underneath. When Peter
      had recovered his breath and looked, there was no sign of the hole. No one
      would ever have guessed that there had been one there.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was Peter Rabbit's first meeting with Grubby Gopher. Since then he
      has seen Grubby several times, but Grubby is never what you would call
      neighborly, and Peter never has felt and never will feel really acquainted
      with him. But for one thing Peter would have thought Grubby Gopher the
      most uninteresting fellow he ever had met. The one thing was the discovery
      that Grubby has the biggest pockets in his cheeks that Peter has ever
      seen. And another thing about those pockets&mdash;they are on the <i>outside</i>
      of Grubby's cheeks instead of being inside, as is the case with Striped
      Chipmunk. &ldquo;When Peter discovered this, he became curious at once. Of
      course. Who wouldn't be curious? Peter felt sure that there must be a
      story in connection with those pockets. He wondered what use Grubby Gopher
      had for pockets, anyway. He wondered why they were outside instead of
      inside his cheeks. He wondered a great many things, did Peter. And when he
      just couldn't stand it any longer for wondering, he began to ask
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why does Grubby Gopher have pockets in his cheeks?&rdquo; he asked Jimmy Skunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because they are handier there than they would be anywhere else,&rdquo; replied
      Jimmy with a twinkle in his eyes. &ldquo;Have you seen any fat beetles this
      morning, Peter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Peter shortly. Then an idea came to him. &ldquo;I tell you what,
      Jimmy,&rdquo; said he, speaking eagerly, &ldquo;if you'll tell me about those queer
      pockets of Grubby's and how he came by them, I'll help you hunt for some
      beetles. Is it a bargain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy Skunk scratched his nose thoughtfully as if trying to decide which
      would have the better of the bargain. Then he grinned good-naturedly. You
      know, Jimmy really is one of the best-natured little people in the world.
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it's a bargain. You do your part and I'll do mine.
      Now where shall I begin?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begin with the days when the world was young, of course,&rdquo; replied Peter.
      &ldquo;All good stories seem to have had their beginnings then, so far as I can
      see. Of course Grubby got those pockets from his father, and his father
      got them from his father, and so on way back to the first Gopher. So begin
      right off with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you say,&rdquo; replied Jimmy. &ldquo;Old Mr. Gopher, the first Gopher, who
      wasn't old then, was one of the little people whom Old Mother Nature
      turned loose in the Great World which was just in its beginning and told
      to make the best of life as they found it. No doubt they would need things
      which they hadn't got, but first they must find out what they really did
      need. Later, when she had more time, she would consider these needs, and
      if they were real needs, not just desires, she would see what could be
      done to supply them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Mr. Gopher started out to make his way in the Great World, and it
      wasn't long before he discovered that everybody else was doing the same
      thing. It soon became clear to him that if everybody lived on the same
      kind of food, there wouldn't be enough to go around, and the biggest and
      strongest creatures would get all there was, leaving the smaller and
      weaker ones to starve. Not long after this he discovered certain of his
      big neighbors had begun to look at him in a way that made him most
      uncomfortable. In fact, they looked at him with such a hungry gleam in
      their eyes, and they licked their lips in such an unpleasant way whenever
      he met them, that little cold shivers ran all over him and he decided that
      the less he was seen the better his chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One other thing Mr. Gopher discovered, and this was that each one seemed
      to have some special gift. One was a good climber, another a swift runner,
      a third a wonderful jumper, a fourth a great swimmer. Mr. Gopher could
      neither climb, nor run, nor jump, nor swim particularly well. What could
      he do? Somehow he had a feeling that Old Mother Nature had given him some
      special advantage. What could it be? He sat down and studied himself. Then
      he noticed for the first time that his hands were different from the hands
      of those about him. For his size they were very large and strong, and on
      the three middle fingers of each hand were long, stout claws. What could
      he do with these besides fight? Dig! That was it; he could dig. He tried
      it. Sure enough, he could dig at a surprising rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then came a new idea. He would dig himself a hole and live in it. That
      would keep him out of sight of his big neighbors with the hungry-looking
      eyes and the watery mouths. So he dug himself a hole, and then he
      discovered that in order to get food he must leave the hole, and so he was
      no better off than before. While he was studying over this, He started a
      little tunnel just for the fun of digging, for he liked to dig, did Mr.
      Gopher. Presently he came to a root in his path. He decided to cut it and
      get it out of his way. Now when he began to cut it he made another
      discovery, one that tickled him half to death. That root was good to eat!
      He ate all of it, and then he went on digging, hoping to find another. He
      did find another. Then Mr. Gopher made up his mind that in the future he
      would live underground and be safe. He would make himself a comfortable
      house, and then from that he would tunnel wherever he pleased for food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Mr. Gopher made a comfortable house underground, and then he started
      digging for food. Every once in a while he would make an opening at the
      surface of the ground and push out the dirt he had dug in making his
      tunnel, filling up the opening as soon as he had pushed out all the dirt.
      In this way he kept his tunnels clear, so that he could run back and forth
      through them. So he lived very comfortably until one day he happened to
      overhear Mr. Squirrel talking about the coming of Jack Frost and telling
      how he wouldn't mind because he was laying up stores of food in a
      storehouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's a good idea of Mr. Squirrel's,' thought Mr. Gopher, who was much
      troubled by what he had heard about the coming of Jack Frost. 'I believe
      I'll do the same thing.' But when he tried it, he found it slow, hard
      work. You see, he could carry so little at a time, and had to carry it so
      far, that it was very discouraging. He had forgotten all about Old Mother
      Nature until suddenly one day she appeared before him and smilingly asked
      what boon she could grant him. Almost without thinking he replied,
      'Pockets! Big pockets in my cheeks!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Mother Nature looked surprised. 'Tell me all about it,' said she.
      'Why do you want pockets, and what would you do with them if you had
      them?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Mr. Gopher explained to Old Mother Nature how he had learned to live
      underground and how lately he had been trying to lay up a store of food
      but had found it slow work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Mother Nature was pleased to think that Mr. Gopher had made the most
      of his opportunities, but she didn't say so. 'I'll think it over,' said
      she and left him. But the very next time Mr. Gopher brushed a hand against
      one of his cheeks, he discovered a great pocket there. Hastily he felt of
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was another great pocket there! Then Mr. Gopher was perfectly
      happy. He felt that there wasn't a single thing in all the world that he
      could ask for to make him any happier. It is just the same way with Grubby
      to-day. He is perfectly happy working in the dark under the ground and
      very, very proud of the big pockets in his cheeks,&rdquo; concluded Jimmy Skunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you ever so much. Now I'll help you find some fat
      beetles,&rdquo; cried Peter.

      III. WHEN OLD MR. GROUSE GOT HIS SNOWSHOES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ETER RABBIT and
      Mrs. Grouse are very good friends. In fact they are the best of friends.
      For one thing they are very near neighbors. Once in a great while Mrs.
      Grouse comes to the dear Old Briar-patch and walks along Peter's private
      little paths. However, that isn't often. But up in the bramble tangle on
      the edge of the Green Forest they spend a great deal of time together. You
      see, they both fear the same enemies, and so they have a great deal to
      talk over, and each is always ready to help the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      When winter comes Peter is sometimes rather lonely. You see, a lot of his
      feathered friends fly away to the warm, sunny Southland to spend the
      winter. Other friends, Johnny Chuck and Striped Chipmunk and Grandfather
      Frog for instance, retire and sleep all through the cold weather. Peter
      cannot understand what they do it for, but they do. So Peter has very few
      to gossip with after Jack Frost arrives. But he can always count on Mrs.
      Grouse. No matter how hard Jack Frost pinches, or how bitter the breath of
      rough Brother North Wind, somewhere in the Green Forest Mrs. Grouse is
      bravely doing her best to get enough to eat, and Peter knows that if he
      looks for her he will find her.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one thing about Mrs. Grouse that puzzled Peter for a long time,
      and this was the difference between the footprints she made in the soft
      damp earth after a rain in the summer and the prints she made in the snow.
      The first time he noticed those prints in the snow, he actually didn't
      know who had made them. You know how very, very curious Peter is. He
      followed those queer footprints, and when he found that they led right
      straight into the bramble tangle, he just didn't know what to think. He
      sat down on the edge of the bramble tangle and scratched his long right
      ear with his long left hind foot. When Peter does this it is a sign that
      he is very much puzzled about something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good morning, Peter Rabbit. You seem to have something on your mind,&rdquo;
       said a voice from the middle of the bramble tangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter gave a little start of surprise. Then he hopped into the bramble
      tangle along one of the little paths he had cut there. &ldquo;Good morning, Mrs.
      Grouse,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I <i>have</i> got something on my mind. I have been
      following some strange tracks, and I don't know what to make of them.&rdquo; He
      pointed at one of them as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Grouse in a tone of great surprise. &ldquo;I made those with
      my snowshoes. I supposed you knew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snowshoes! What are snow-shoes?&rdquo; asked Peter, looking more puzzled than
      ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very proudly Mrs. Grouse held out one foot for Peter to look at. Instead
      of the slim smooth toes he often had admired Peter saw that the bottom of
      each was covered for its whole length with queer-looking, horny little
      points that prevented the foot from sinking way down in the snow as it
      would have done without them. This made it very easy for Mrs. Grouse to
      get about on the snow instead of having to wade through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;How perfectly splendid! Where did you get them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Grouse with pride in her voice, &ldquo;they have been in the
      family a great many years. They were given to my
      great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather by Old Mother Nature.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me about it. Do please tell me about it,&rdquo; begged Peter, who had not
      had a story since Grandfather Frog went to sleep for the winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grouse fluffed out her feathers and settled herself comfortably.
      &ldquo;There isn't much to tell,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;but all the same our family always
      has been rather proud of the way we came by our snowshoes. It all happened
      a great while ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Way back in the time that Grandfather Frog tells about, when the world
      was young?&rdquo; interrupted Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Grouse nodded and went on. &ldquo;Great-grandfather Grouse lived very
      comfortably in those days, even when the hard times came and so many took
      to killing their neighbors because food was scarce. He always managed to
      get enough to eat because he didn't believe in being fussy. When he
      couldn't get what he wanted, he took what he could get and was thankful.
      When he couldn't find grasshoppers or crickets or bugs of any kind, or
      chestnuts or beechnuts or berries that he liked, he ate such berries as he
      could find, whether he liked them or not; and when he couldn't find
      berries or seeds, he ate the buds of trees. So one way or another he
      managed to pick up a living and to keep out of the way of his enemies, for
      he was just as smart as they were. You know, in those days there were no
      hunters with dreadful guns.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Grandfather Grouse managed to get along without really suffering until
      the coming of the first snow. That first snow was hard on everybody, but
      it was particularly hard on Grandfather Grouse. His slim toes cut right
      through. They wouldn't hold him up at all. Of course he spent as much time
      as possible up in the trees, but when he wanted to get low-hanging berries
      on the bushes, the kind that stay on all winter, you know, he just had to
      stand on the ground and reach up for them. Then, too, his feet were
      intended for walking and running rather than for perching in trees, and it
      made his toes ache dreadfully to have to cling to the branch of a tree too
      long. I know just how it felt because I have had to do it when Reddy Fox
      has been hunting for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Grandfather Grouse made the best of a bad matter and didn't say a
      word, not a word. He waded around in the snow as best he could, but it was
      dreadfully tiresome. He couldn't take more than a few steps without
      stopping to rest. And this wasn't all; the snow made his feet ache with
      the cold. He had to keep drawing first one foot and then the other up to
      warm them in his feathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Grandfather Grouse had sharp eyes, and he knew how to use them. He
      had to, to keep out of danger. He watched the other little people, and he
      soon saw that those with big feet, feet that were big for the size of
      their bodies, didn't sink in like those with small, slim feet. For the
      first time in his life he began to wish that Old Mother Nature had made
      him different. He wished that he had broad feet. Yes, Sir, he wished just
      that. Then a thought popped into his head. Perhaps the snow wasn't going
      to last forever. Perhaps it would go away and never come again. Then he
      wouldn't want broad feet, but just the kind of feet he already had. He
      sighed. Then he tried to smile bravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I guess,' said he, talking out loud to himself, for he thought he was
      quite alone, 'I guess the thing to do is to stop worrying about the things
      I haven't got and make the most of the blessings I have got,' and he
      started to wade through the snow for some berries just ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Old Mother Nature happened to be passing, and she overheard
      Grandfather Grouse. 'I wish that every one felt as you do.' said she. 'It
      would make things a great deal easier for me. But what is it that you wish
      you had?'&rdquo; Grandfather Grouse felt both pleased and a little ashamed&mdash;ashamed
      that he should even <i>seem</i> to be dissatisfied. At first he tried to
      pretend that everything really was all right, but after a little urging he
      told Old Mother Nature all about his troubles since the coming of the
      snow. She listened and looked thoughtful. Then she told Grandfather Grouse
      to be patient and perhaps things would not be so bad as they seemed.
      Somehow Grandfather Grouse felt better after that, and when he went to bed
      for the night in a big hemlock-tree he was almost cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next morning when he flew down to get his breakfast, he had the
      greatest surprise of his life. Instead of sinking way down into the snow,
      he sank hardly at all. He could get about with the greatest ease. He
      didn't know what to make of it until he happened to look down at his feet
      and then he saw&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That he had snowshoes!&rdquo; interrupted Peter Rabbit, dancing about in great
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Grouse. &ldquo;He had snowshoes just like the ones I
      have now. When spring came, Old Mother Nature came around and took them
      away, because he no longer had need of them; but when the next winter
      came, she returned them to him. She called them the reward of patience.
      And ever since that long-ago day our family has had snowshoes in the
      winter. I really don't know how we would get along without them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how you would,&rdquo; replied Peter Rabbit. &ldquo;Isn't it splendid how
      Old Mother Nature seems to know just what everybody needs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And with that Peter started for the dear Old Briar-patch to tell little
      Mrs. Peter all about the snowshoes of Mrs. Grouse.

      IV. WHEN OLD MR. PANTHER LOST HIS HONOR
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ETER RABBIT,
      always curious, had overheard his cousin, Jumper the Hare, tell Prickly
      Porky the Porcupine that it was lucky for him Puma the Panther was too
      much afraid of men to come down to the Green Forest to live, but kept to
      the Great Woods and the Big Mountains. At the very mention of Puma the
      thousand little spears of Prickly Porky had rattled together, and Peter
      had a queer feeling that this time, instead of being rattled purposely to
      make others afraid, they rattled because Prickly Porky himself shook with
      something very like fear. In fact, it seemed to Peter that Prickly Porky
      actually turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Peter knew nothing at all about Puma the Panther, and right away he
      was so full of questions that he could hardly wait to get Jumper alone so
      that he might satisfy his curiosity. The first chance he got he began to
      ask questions so fast that Jumper clapped his hands over both ears and
      threatened to run away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is Puma? Where does he live? Why is Prickly Porky afraid of him? What
      does he look like? Why&mdash;&rdquo; It was then that Jumper clapped his hands
      over his ears. Peter grinned. &ldquo;Please, Cousin Jumper, tell me about him,&rdquo;
       he begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jumper pretended to consider for a few minutes. Then, because like most
      people he likes to air his knowledge, and also because he is very fond of
      his cousin Peter, he told him what he knew about Puma the Panther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the first place,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Puma is the biggest member of the Cat
      family living in the Great Woods.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he bigger than Tuffy the Lynx?&rdquo; asked Peter eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jumper nodded, and Peter's eyes opened very wide. &ldquo;He looks very much like
      Black Pussy, Farmer Brown's cat, only he is yellowish-brown instead of
      black, and is ever and ever and ever so many times bigger,&rdquo; continued
      Jumper. &ldquo;He has a long tail, just like Black Pussy, and great claws which
      are terribly sharp. He is so soft-footed that he can steal through the
      woods without making a sound; he can climb trees like Happy Jack Squirrel,
      and he is so big and strong that every one but Buster Bear is afraid of
      him, even Prickly Porky, for he is so smart and cunning that he has found
      a way to make Prickly Porky's thousand little spears quite useless to
      protect him. But big and strong and smart as he is, he is a coward because
      he is a sneak, and all sneaks are cowards. Of course, you know that,
      Peter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter nodded. &ldquo;Everybody knows that,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But if he is so big and
      strong and smart, why is he a sneak?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess it's in his blood, and he can't help himself,&rdquo; replied Jumper. &ldquo;I
      guess it is because way back in the beginning of things his
      great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather lost his honor, and none of the
      family ever has got it back again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did old Mr. Panther lose his honor?&rdquo; demanded Peter, fairly itching
      with curiosity and eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied Jumper, &ldquo;all I know is what I've heard whispered about
      among the people of the Great Woods. It may be true and it may not be, but
      every one seems to believe it. As I said before, it happened way back in
      the beginning of things. Old King Bear ruled the Great Woods then, and
      there was peace between all the animals. Mr. Panther was sleek and
      handsome and graceful in all his movements. He knew it, too. He spent a
      great deal of time washing himself and smoothing his fur, just as Black
      Pussy does. He would stretch out in the sun for hours with his eyes closed
      until they were just slits. But all the time he saw all that was going on
      around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would watch old King Bear shuffling about in his clumsy fashion, and
      he would curl the end of his tail up and twitch it scornfully. Then he
      would look at his own trim form admiringly and think how much
      finer-looking a king he would make. The more he watched old King Bear, the
      more this feeling grew. He became envious and then jealous. But he took
      care never to let old King Bear know this. You see, there was one thing
      about King Bear which Mr. Panther did respect, and that was his strength.
      He had no desire to quarrel with King Bear. So whenever they met he was
      very polite and said flattering things to him. But behind his back Mr.
      Panther made fun of him, but did it in such an artful way that his
      neighbors merely thought that they themselves were making the discovery of
      how much handsomer Mr. Panther was than old King Bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After a while came the hard time when food was scarce, and in order to
      keep from starving, the big and strong began to prey on their neighbors
      who were smaller or weaker or more helpless. But the law was made that
      none should kill more than was needed to fill an empty stomach for the
      time being. It was then that Mr. Panther thought of a plan for making old
      King Bear hated by all his subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If they hate him, they will refuse to have him as king any longer, and
      I, being next in strength and far more kingly in appearance, will be made
      king in his place,' reasoned Mr. Panther, but he took care not to hint
      such a thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently ugly stories began to float about. Some one was killing
      seemingly for the fun of killing. It was dreadful, but it was true. Almost
      every day some one was found killed but not eaten, and always there were
      footprints going to and away from the place, and they were the footprints
      of <i>old King Bear!</i> So all the forest people began to hate King Bear
      and to mutter among themselves that they would have him for king no
      longer. Finally some of them went to Old Mother Nature and told her all
      about it; they asked that old King Bear be punished and that some one else
      be made king in his place. Old Mother Nature told them that she would
      think it over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite unknown to old King Bear, she followed him about and watched him as
      he shuffled about in his clumsy way. 'Hm-m, it ought not to be very hard
      to keep out of his way. Those who are caught must be very stupid if <i>he</i>
      catches them,' thought she. Presently her sharp eyes caught a glimpse of a
      shadowy form sneaking along behind old King Bear. It was Mr. Panther, and
      he was stepping with the greatest care so as to leave no footprints. Old
      Mother Nature sat down and waited. She saw Mr. Panther bound away through
      the trees. By and by he came back, bringing the body of a Hare which he
      had killed. He laid it down where old King Bear had left a footprint in
      the soft earth and then, with his long tail twitching, he looked this way
      and that way to make sure that no one had seen him and then bounded away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next day Old Mother Nature called all the people of the forest before
      her, and they all came, for none dared stay away. When they were all
      there, she had each in turn look her straight in the face while she asked
      if they had hunted fairly and honorably and only when they were hungry.
      Each in turn looked her straight in the face and said that he had until it
      came the turn of Mr. Panther. Mr. Panther's tail twitched nervously, and
      he looked everywhere but at Old Mother Nature as she put the question to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Look me straight in the face and tell me on your honor that you have
      hunted fairly,' commanded Old Mother Nature. Mr. Panther knew that all
      eyes were upon him, and he tried his best to look her in the face, but he
      couldn't do it. You see, he hadn't any honor. He had lost it, and without
      honor no one can look another straight in the face. Instead he turned and
      began to slink away, and all who saw him wondered how they ever could have
      thought him kingly-looking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Old Mother Nature told what she had seen the day before, and at once
      everybody understood who it was that had been doing the killing and trying
      to make it appear that it was old King Bear, and they all turned and
      shouted 'Coward! Sneak! Coward! Sneak!' until Mr. Panther fairly ran to
      get out of hearing. From that time on he lived by himself and would not
      look even timid Mr. Hare in the face. Instead of hunting openly and boldly
      like Mr. Wolf, he sneaked about in the forest and hunted by stealth, so
      that all the people of the forest looked on him with scorn, and though
      most of them feared him, they called him a coward and they nicknamed him
      'Sneak-cat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And to this day all Panthers have been the same, sneaking and cowardly in
      spite of their great size and strength, for it has been in their blood
      ever since the time when old Mr. Panther lost his honor,&rdquo; ended Jumper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter was silent for a minute. Then he said softly: &ldquo;I'm little and timid,
      but I'd rather be that way than to be big like Puma but a coward and a
      sneak. I can look any one in the face.&rdquo;

      V. WHEN OLD MR. RAT BECAME AN OUTCAST
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>obber the brown
      rat is an outcast among the little people of the Green Meadows and the
      Green Forest. You know an outcast is one with whom no one else will have
      anything to do. No one speaks to Robber. Whoever meets him pretends not to
      even see him, unless it happens to be one of the Hawk family or one of the
      Owl family or Shadow the Weasel. If one of these sees him, it is well for
      Robber to find a safe hiding-place without any loss of time.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the rest of the little meadow and forest people turn their backs on
      Robber and get out of his way, partly because many of them are afraid of
      him, and partly because they despise him and consider him quite beneath
      them. He hasn't a single friend among them, not even among his own
      relatives. The latter are ashamed of him. If they could help it, they
      wouldn't even admit that they are related to him. Just mention him to
      them, and right away they will begin to talk about something else. Wag the
      Wood Rat and Bounder the Kangeroo Rat are very different fellows and are
      well liked, but Robber the Brown Rat is hated. Yes, Sir, he is hated even
      by his own relatives, which, you will agree, is a dreadful state of
      affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter Rabbit had heard of Robber but never had seen him until one
      moonlight night he happened to go up to Farmer Brown's barn just out of
      curiosity. He saw a hole under the barn and was trying to decide whether
      or not to go in and find out what was inside when who should come out but
      Robber himself. His coat was so rough and untidy, he was so dirty, he
      smelled so unclean, and he looked so savage that Peter at once decided
      that he wasn't interested in that barn and took himself off to the Green
      Forest, lip-perty-lipperty-lip, as fast as he could go. All the rest of
      the night he thought about Robber the Brown Rat, and the very next day he
      hurried over to the Smiling Pool to ask Grandfather Frog how it was that
      Robber had become such a disreputable fellow with not a single friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandfather Frog had had a good breakfast of foolish green flies and was
      feeling in the very best of humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chug-a-rum!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;Robber the Brown Rat is an outcast because he is
      all bad. His father was all bad, and his father's father, and so on way
      back to the beginning of things when the world was young. There was no
      good in any of them, and there is no good in Robber. He is a disgrace to
      the whole race of meadow and forest people, and so he lives only where man
      lives, and I have heard that he is as much hated by man as by the rest of
      us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Way back when the world was young, his
      great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather, who was the first of his race,
      lived with the rest of the little people in the Green Forest, and Old
      Mother Nature gave him the same chance to make an honest living that she
      gave to the rest. For a while Mr. Rat was honest. He was honest just as
      long as it was easier to be honest than dishonest. But when the hard times
      came of which you know, and food became scarce, Mr. Rat was too lazy to
      even try to earn his own living. He discovered that it was easier to steal
      from his neighbors. He wasn't at all particular whom he stole from, but he
      took from big and little alike. He was so sly about it that for a long
      time no one found him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By and by his neighbors began to wonder how it was that Mr. Rat always
      seemed fat and well fed and yet never was seen to work. But Mr. Rat was
      too crafty to be caught stealing. He said he didn't need much to live on,
      which was an untruth, for he was a very greedy fellow. Now laziness is a
      habit that grows. First Mr. Rat was too lazy to work for his living. Then,
      little by little, he grew too lazy to be crafty. He grew bolder and bolder
      in his stealing, until at last he just took what he pleased from those who
      were smaller than he. Being well fed, he was strong. All the little people
      of his own size and smaller feared him. The bigger people said it was no
      business of theirs, so long as he didn't steal from them. All the time he
      <i>was</i> stealing from them, but hadn't been caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally he grew too lazy to keep himself looking neat. His coat was
      always unbrushed and untidy-looking. He was always dirty. You see, it was
      too much work to even wash his face and hands. There was always food
      sticking to his whiskers. The little people kept away from him because
      they were afraid of him. The bigger people would have nothing to do with
      him because they were ashamed of him, ashamed to be seen in his company.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0087.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So lazy Mr. Rat grew dirtier in his habits, bolder in his stealing, and
      impudent to everybody. He became quarrelsome. It was about this time that
      the bigger people found him out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lynx had secured the first meal he had had in a week. Part of it he
      put away for the next day. Before going to bed he went to have a look at
      it. Some of it was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's queer,' muttered Mr. Lynx. 'I wonder who there is who dares to
      steal from me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Lynx hid where he could watch what was left of that meal. By and by
      he grew sleepy. He was just dozing off when he heard a noise. There was
      Mr. Rat carrying off part of what was left of that meal. With a snarl of
      anger Mr. Lynx leaped out. But Mr. Rat was too quick for him. He slipped
      into a hole. Mr. Lynx grabbed at him and caught him by the tail. Mr. Rat
      pulled and Mr. Lynx pulled. But Mr. Rat's tail was slippery, and Mr. Lynx
      couldn't hold on. He did, however, pull all the hair from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Mr. Lynx told what had happened, and after that Mr. Rat did
      not dare show himself at all when the bigger people were about. So he
      lived in holes and continued to steal. Finally old King Bear called a
      meeting, and it was decided to drive Mr. Rat out of the Green Forest and
      off the Green Meadows. Little Mr. Weasel said that he was not afraid of
      Mr. Rat, and he would go into all the holes and drive Mr. Rat out. So Mr.
      Weasel went into hole after hole until at last he found Mr. Rat. Mr. Rat
      tried to fight, but he found that little Mr. Weasel was so slim and could
      move so quickly that he couldn't get hold of him. So at last Mr. Rat was
      forced to run to save his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The minute he appeared all the others, big and little, started for him.
      Mr. Rat gave one look, and then, with a squeal of fright, he ran with all
      his might, dodging into one hiding-place after another, only to be chased
      out of each. And so at last he turned away from the Green Forest and the
      Green Meadows and ran to the homes of men, where he hid in dark places and
      stole from men as he formerly had stolen from his neighbors of the Green
      Forest. And because men are wasteful and allow much food to spoil, Mr. Rat
      found plenty to fill his stomach, such as it was, but often it was such as
      no one else would have touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once or twice he tried to get back to the Green Forest, but as soon as he
      was discovered he was driven back, and at last he gave up trying. He grew
      more dirty than ever, and finding everybody, even man, against him, he
      became savage of temper, living wholly by stealing, evil to look at and
      evil to come near, for in the dirt of his coat be carried sickness from
      place to place. In no place in all the Great World could he find a
      welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His children followed in his footsteps, and his children's children. Old
      Mother Nature became so disgusted with them that she said that they should
      always remain outcasts until they should mend their ways. But this they
      never did, and so Robber the Brown Rat is an outcast to-day, looked down
      on and hated by every living thing. There is none to say a good word for
      him. And to this day the tails of Bobber's family have been almost bare of
      hair as a reminder of how old Mr. Rat of long ago came to be driven out of
      the Green Forest. Now are you satisfied, Peter Rabbit?&rdquo; concluded
      Grandfather Frog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, and I thank you ever so much,&rdquo; declared Peter. &ldquo;Ugh! It must
      be dreadful to be despised and hated by all the Great World. I wouldn't be
      in Robber's place for anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chug-a-rum! I should hope not!&rdquo; said Grandfather Frog.

      VI. WHEN MR. MOOSE LOST HIS HORNS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ETER RABBIT had
      just seen Flathorns the Moose for the first time, and Peter was having
      hard work to believe that there wasn't something the matter with his eyes.
      Indeed they looked as if something was the matter with them, for they
      seemed about to pop right out of his head. If any one had <i>told</i>
      Peter that any one as big as Flathorns lived in the Great Woods, he
      wouldn't have believed it, but now that he had <i>seen</i> that it was so,
      he just had to believe. So Peter sat with his eyes popping out and his
      mouth gaping wide open in the most foolish way as he stared in the
      direction in which Flathorns had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big, isn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked up to see Blacky the Crow in the top of a birch-tree just at
      one side, and Blacky, too, was looking after Flathorns. Then Blacky looked
      down at Peter and began to laugh. &ldquo;Don't try to swallow him, Peter!&rdquo; said
      he.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0099.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Peter closed his mouth with a snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My, but he <i>is</i> big!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I never felt so small in all my
      life as when I first caught sight of him. What queer horns he has! I
      suppose they are horns, for he carries them on his head just as Lightfoot
      the Deer does his. They are so big I should think they would make his head
      ache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps they do, and that is why he drops them every spring and grows a
      new pair during the summer,&rdquo; replied Blacky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drops them! Drops those great horns and grows new ones in a single
      summer! Do you mean to tell me that hard things like those horns grow? And
      what do you mean by saying that he drops them every spring? Why, I saw him
      banging them against a tree just now, and I guess if they ever were coming
      off they would have come off then. You can't fool me with any such story
      as that, Blacky!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have it your own way, Peter,&rdquo; replied Blacky. &ldquo;Some people never can
      believe a thing until they see it with their own eyes. All I've got to say
      is just keep an eye on Flathorns in the spring and then remember what I've
      told you.&rdquo; Before Peter could reply Blacky had spread his wings, and with
      a harsh &ldquo;Caw, caw, caw,&rdquo; had flown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, after that Peter was very very curious about Flathorns the
    </p>
    <p>
      Moose, and he just ached all over to ask about those horns. But every time
      he saw them the idea that they ever would or could come off seemed so
      impossible that he held his tongue. You see, he didn't want to be laughed
      at. So the winter passed, and Peter was no wiser than before. Then the
      spring came, and one never-to-be-forgotten day Peter was hurrying along,
      lipperty-lipperty-lip, when right in front of him lay something that made
      him stop short and stare even harder than he had stared the first time he
      saw Flat-horns. What was it? Why, it was one of those very horns he had
      thought so much about! Yes, Sir, that is just what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even then Peter couldn't believe it was so. He couldn't believe it until
      he had hunted up Flathorns himself and seen with his own eyes that there
      were no longer any horns on that great head. Then Peter <i>had</i> to
      believe. It seemed to Peter the strangest thing he ever had heard of.
      There must be a reason, and if there were, Grandfather Frog would be sure
      to know it. So every day Peter visited the Smiling Pool to see if
      Grandfather Frog had wakened from his long winter sleep. At last one day
      he found him and could hardly wait to tell him how glad he was to see him
      once more and to be properly polite before he asked him about those horns
      of Flat-horns the Moose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chug-a-rum!&rdquo; said Grandfather Frog. &ldquo;It's pretty early in the season to
      be asking me for a story, but seeing it is you, Peter, and that you've
      waited all winter for it, I'll tell it to you. Way, way back in the days
      when the world was young, the first Moose, the
      great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather of Flathorns, was the biggest of all
      the animals in the Green Forest, but he had no horns, and he was such a
      homely fellow that everybody laughed at him and made fun of him. Now
      nothing hurts quite so much as being laughed at.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; interrupted Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Moose felt so badly about it that he used to hide away and keep out
      of sight all he possibly could,&rdquo; continued Grandfather Frog. &ldquo;Big as he
      was and strong as he was, he would turn and run away to hide from even
      such little people as Mr. Skunk and Mr. Squirrel and your
      ever-so-great-grand-father, Mr. Rabbit. He just couldn't bear to be
      laughed at. Old Mother Nature kept her eye on him and at last she took
      pity on him and crowned his head with the most wonderful horns, horns so
      big that no one smaller than Mr. Moose could possibly have carried them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Mr. Moose threw up his head and carried it proudly, for now no one
      laughed at him. He marched through the Great Woods boldly, and even old
      King Bear, who was king no longer, stepped aside respectfully. Then pride
      entered into Mr. Moose; pride in his wonderful horns; pride in his great
      strength. He feared no one. He beat the bushes with his great horns and
      bellowed until the Great Woods rang with his voice, and all those who had
      once laughed at him hid in fear. He proclaimed himself king of the Great
      Woods, and no one dared to deny it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he came and went when and where he pleased and felt himself every inch
      a king and carried his great horns as a crown. One day in the beginning of
      the springtime, he came face to face with Old Mother Nature. Once he would
      have bowed to her very humbly, but by now he had grown so proud and
      haughty that instead of stepping aside for her to pass, he boldly marched
      on with his head held high as if he did not see her. It was Old Mother
      Nature who stepped aside. She said nothing, but as he passed she reached
      forth and touched his great horns and they fell from his head, and with
      them fell all his pride and haughtiness. At once some of his neighbors who
      had been hiding near and had seen all that had happened began to mock him
      and make fun of him and laugh at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then, with his head hung low in shame, did Mr. Moose slink away and hide
      as he had done in the beginning, and none could find him save Old Mother
      Nature. Very humble was Mr. Moose when she visited him; all his pride was
      melted away in shame. Old Mother Nature was sorry for him. She promised
      him that he should have new horns, but that once a year he should lose his
      horns lest he should forget and again become over-proud and haughty. So
      while he kept hidden, the new horns grew and grew until they were greater
      and more wonderful than the ones he had had before. Then Mr. Moose once
      more came forth, holding his head high and glorying in his strength, and
      all his neighbors treated him with the greatest respect, quite as if he
      were really king of the Great Woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he never forgot what Old Mother Nature had said to him, and when the
      spring came, he slipped away and hid lest he should be seen without the
      glory of his horns, for in his heart he knew that Old Mother Nature would
      keep her word. Sure enough, his great horns dropped off, and in humbleness
      and patience he waited for new horns to grow. So it was all the years of
      his life, and so it has been with his children and his grandchildren even
      to this day, and so it is with Flathorns, and so it will be with his
      children. And the Moose family never have forgotten and never can forget
      that there is nothing so foolish as pride in personal appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Peter, as Grandfather Frog stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't that enough?&rdquo; demanded Grandfather Frog testily. &ldquo;Just think it
      over a while, and when you are tempted to be proud and haughty just
      remember the horns of Mr. Moose and what happened to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you ever so much for the story,&rdquo; replied Peter politely as he
      hopped away. Half way to the dear Old Briar-patch he paused. &ldquo;It served
      old Mr. Moose just right!&rdquo; he declared to no one in particular. And so it
      did.

    <h2>
      VII. WHEN MR. KINGFISHER TOOK TO THE GROUND
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ETER RABBIT had
      taken it into his funny little head to wander down the Laughing Brook
      below the Smiling Pool. It was open there, and in one place the bank was
      quite high and steep. Peter sat down on the edge of it and looked down.
      Right under him the Laughing Brook was very quiet and clear. Peter sat
      gazing down into it. He could see all the pebbles on the bottom and queer
      little plants growing among them. It seemed very queer, very queer indeed
      to Peter that plants, real plants, could be growing down there under
      water. Somehow he couldn't make it seem right that anything but fish
      should be able to live down there.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Peter sat gazing down, lost in a sort of day-dream. The Jolly Little
      Sunbeams made beautiful lights and shadows in the water. Everything was so
      peaceful and beautiful that Peter quite forgot he was sitting right out in
      the open where Redtail the Hawk might spy him. He just gave himself up to
      dreams, day-dreams, you know. Presently those day-dreams were very, very
      near to being sleep-dreams. Yes, Sir, they were. Peter actually was
      nodding. His big eyes would close, open, close again, open and then close
      for a little longer. Suddenly a sharp and very loud noise, which seemed to
      come from right under his very toes, put an end to all nodding and
      dreaming. It was a long, harsh rattle, and it startled Peter so that he
      almost jumped out of his skin. Anyway, he jumped straight up in the air,
      and the wonder was that he didn't tumble headfirst down that steep bank
      right into the Laughing Brook. A queer prickly feeling ran all over him.
      He blinked his eyes rapidly. Then he saw a handsome blue and white and
      gray bird, with a head that looked too big for his body, flying up the
      Laughing Brook just above the water, and as he flew he made that sharp,
      harsh, rattling noise which had startled Peter so. Abruptly he paused in
      his flight, hovered over the water an instant, shot down, and disappeared
      with a tinkling little splash. A second later he was in the air again, and
      in his stout, spear-like bill was a gleaming, silvery thing. It was a
      little fish, a minnow.

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0115.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rattles the Kingfisher!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter, as he watched him fly over to a
      tree, pound the fish on a branch, and then go through the funniest
      performance as he tried to swallow the minnow whole. &ldquo;Now where did he
      come from?&rdquo; continued Peter. &ldquo;It certainly seemed to me that he came from
      right under my very feet, but there isn't so much as a twig down there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter poked his head over the edge of the bank. No, there wasn't a single
      thing down there on which Rattles could have been sitting. He was still
      wondering about it when his wobbly little nose caught a smell, a very
      unpleasant smell. It was the smell of fish, and it seemed to come from
      right under him. He leaned a little farther over the edge of the bank, and
      then he gave a funny little gasp. There was a <i>hole</i> in the bank only
      a few inches below him, and the smell certainly came from that hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could it be, could it possibly be that Rattles had come out of that hole?
      It certainly seemed so, and yet Peter couldn't quite believe it. The very
      idea of a bird living in a hole in the ground!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it! I don't, so there!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter right out loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you don't believe?&rdquo; asked a voice. Peter looked down. There
      was Little Joe Otter looking up at him from the water, his eyes twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe that Rattles the Kingfisher came out of that hole, yet I
      don't see where else he could have come from,&rdquo; replied Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Joe chuckled. &ldquo;That's where he came from, even if you don't believe
      it,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I don't suppose you will believe that he dug that hole
      himself, either.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter's eyes opened very wide. &ldquo;I&mdash;I'll believe it if you say on your
      honor that it realty is so,&rdquo; he replied slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On my honor it really is so,&rdquo; said Little Joe Otter, his eyes twinkling
      more than ever. &ldquo;Perhaps you would like to know how the
      great-great-grandfather of Rattles the Kingfisher happened to take the
      ground for a home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter's eyes fairly danced. &ldquo;Do tell me, Little Joe! Oh, please tell me!&rdquo;
       he exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Joe climbed out of the water on a rock just below Peter and settled
      himself comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once upon a time,&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the beginning of things,&rdquo; prompted Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in the beginning of things,&rdquo; replied Little Joe, &ldquo;way back when the
      world was young, lived the very first of the Kingfisher family. From the
      very beginning Mr. Kingfisher was a very independent fellow. He cared
      nothing about his neighbors. That is, he was not social. He was polite
      enough, but he preferred his own company and was never happier than when
      he was by himself. Of course, his neighbors soon found this out. They
      called him odd and queer, and soon refused to even speak to him. This just
      suited Mr. Kingfisher, and he went about his business very well content to
      be let alone. He spent his days fishing, and, because there were few other
      fishermen, he always had plenty to eat. At night he found a comfortable
      roost in a tree, and so for a time he was perfectly contented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By and by he discovered that most of his neighbors were building homes.
      At first he gave little attention to this, but after a while, seeing how
      happy they were, he began to think about a home for himself. The more he
      thought about it, the more he wanted one. But underneath Mr. Kingfisher's
      pointed cap were very clever wits. He would do nothing hastily. So he flew
      up and down the brook, appearing to do nothing but fish, but all the time
      he was keeping his eyes open, and there were no sharper eyes than those of
      Mr. Kingfisher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was watching his neighbors work to see where and how they made their
      homes. He saw some of the birds building nests in the trees, some building
      them in the bushes, and a few building right on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of all he saw he liked best the home of Drummer the Woodpecker. 'That
      fellow has the right idea,' thought he. 'He cuts a hole in a tree; he is
      dry; he is warm; and no one can get at him there. If I build a home, that
      is the kind of place I want. He has got what I call plain sense, plain
      common sense!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After this Mr. Kingfisher watched until he was quite sure that no one was
      around to see him, and then he tried to make a hole in a tree as he had
      seen Drummer the Woodpecker do. But right away he discovered that two
      things were wrong; his bill was not made for cutting wood, and his feet
      were not big enough or the right shape for clinging to the side of a tree.
      Mr. Kingfisher was disappointed, very much disappointed. A hole seemed to
      him the only kind of a place for a home. He was thinking it over when he
      happened to discover Mr. Muskrat digging a hole in the bank. At first he
      didn't pay much attention. Then all in a flash an idea, a wonderful idea,
      came to him. Why shouldn't he have a home in the ground? No one in the
      wide world would ever think of looking for the home of a bird in the
      ground. With a rattle of joy, Mr. Kingfisher flew off up the brook to a
      steep, sandy bank of which he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Just the place! Just the very place!' he cried. 'I'll make a hole just a
      little way from the top. No one will see it except from below, and it will
      be hard work for any one to climb up that sandy bank.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He flew straight at the spot he had selected and drove his big spear-like
      bill into it. Then he did it again and again. That bill wouldn't cut wood
      like the bill of Drummer the Woodpecker, but it certainly would cut into a
      sandy bank. In a little while he had room to cling with his feet. Then he
      could work faster and more easily. Pretty soon he had a hole deep enough
      to get into. He would loosen the earth with his hill and scrape it out
      with his feet. He was so pleased with his discovery that he kept right on
      working. He almost forgot to eat. All the time he could spare from
      fishing, he spent digging. Day after day he worked. When he had a hole
      three or four feet straight into the bank, he made a turn in it and then
      kept on digging. When he had gone far enough in, he made a little bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last the house was done. Mr. Kingfisher chuckled happily. No one could
      get at him there. He had the best and safest home he knew of. It was
      better than the home of Drummer the Woodpecker. If Mr. Mink happened to
      find it, and Mr. Kingfisher could think of no one else who would be likely
      to, there would be nothing to fear, for Mr. Mink would never dare face
      that sharp hill in such a narrow place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It all worked out just as Mr. Kingfisher thought it would. No one dreamed
      of looking in the ground for his home, and for a long, long time he kept
      his secret so well that his neighbors thought he had no home, and called
      him 'Rattles the Homeless.' From that day to this the Kingfishers have
      made their homes in the ground,&rdquo; concluded Little Joe Otter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it wonderful?&rdquo; exclaimed Peter, as he watched Rattles dive into the
      water and catch a silvery minnow. &ldquo;I didn't know that any one wearing
      feathers had so much sense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a great deal you don't know, Peter,&rdquo; replied Little Joe Otter,
      sliding into the water.

      VIII. WHEN OLD MR. BADGER LEARNED TO STAY AT HOME
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE first time
      Peter Rabbit saw Digger the Badger, he laughed at him. Yes, Sir, Peter
      laughed at him. He laughed until he had to hold his sides. When he got
      back to the dear Old Briar-patch, he told little Mrs. Peter all about
      Digger. That is, he told her all that he had seen, which was really very
      little indeed about Digger, as he found out later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found him away over on the Green Meadows in a place where I have never
      been before, and I almost stepped on him before I saw him. You should have
      seen me jump. I guess it is lucky I did, too, for he certainly has got the
      wickedest-looking teeth, and I didn't like the way he snarled. Then at a
      safe distance I sat down and laughed. I just had to. Why, his legs are so
      short and his coat hangs down so on each side that he doesn't seem to have
      any legs at all. And as for shape, he hasn't any. He is so broad and flat
      that he looks as if something big and heavy had passed over him and rolled
      him out flat. But how he can dig! If Johnny Chuck should ever see him
      digging, Johnny would die of envy. I'm going over there again to learn
      more about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better stay at home and mind your own affairs,&rdquo; replied little Mrs.
      Peter tartly. &ldquo;No good comes of poking into the affairs of other people.&rdquo;
       This is true, and Peter knows it, but he just couldn't keep away from that
      part of the Green Meadows where he had discovered Digger the Badger. The
      more he saw of Digger, the greater became his curiosity about him. The
      less Peter can find out for himself about any one, the more curious he
      becomes, and all he could find out about Digger was that he slept most of
      the day, never went far from home, could dig faster than any one Peter had
      ever heard of, was short-tempered, and was treated with respect by all his
      neighbors, even Old Man Coyote, who seemed to know him very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this made Peter more curious than ever, so one day, when Old Man
      Coyote happened along by the Old Briar-patch, Peter ventured to ask him
      about Digger the Badger. Old Man Coyote happened to be feeling in fine
      humor, for he had just eaten a good dinner. So he sat down just outside
      the dear Old Briar-patch, and this is what he told Peter:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Digger is an old friend of mine, and I would advise you to treat him with
      the greatest respect, Peter, because if you don't, and he ever gets his
      claws on you, that will be the end of you. I wouldn't care to get in a
      fight with him myself, big as I am. You may have noticed that no one ever
      bothers him.&rdquo; Peter nodded, and Old Man Coyote continued: &ldquo;I don't know of
      any one who minds his own business and keeps his nose out of the affairs
      of other people as Digger does. Greatest homebody I know of, unless it's
      Johnny Chuck, and even Johnny wanders off once in a while. But Digger
      never gets very far from his own doorstep. Says there is no place like
      home, and he can't see what anybody wants to leave the best place in the
      world for, even if they can come back to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Peter reached over and poked Peter in the back, but he didn't even
      look at her. You know, she is always trying to keep Peter from roaming
      about so. Old Man Coyote went on with his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't because Digger is afraid. Goodness, no! I don't know of any one
      better able to take care of himself than Digger the Badger. I guess it is
      because his family always have been home-lovers. I've heard my grandfather
      tell how Digger's grandfather was just the same as Digger is, and how he
      had heard his grandfather say the same thing about Digger's grandfather's
      grandfather. They say that the very first Badger, who founded the family
      way back in the days when the world was young, started this home-staying
      habit, and that all Badgers ever since then have been just like him.
      Digger is terribly proud of his family and of old Mr. Badger, who founded
      it so long ago. I don't know as I wonder at it. Old Mr. Badger certainly
      had more sense than some of his neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, when Old Mother Nature first turned him loose in the Great
      World, he felt that she had not been at all fair in her treatment of him.
      His legs were so short and he was so broad and flat that everybody or
      nearly everybody laughed at him and good-naturedly poked fun at him. He
      pretended not to care, but he did care, just the same. No one really likes
      to be laughed at for something he cannot help. Mr. Badger would watch his
      neighbors, Mr. Wolf and Mr. Fox and Mr. Rabbit and others, run and jump,
      and then he would try to do as they did, and he couldn't because his legs
      were so short and so clumsy. He would sit for hours admiring the graceful
      forms of his neighbors and comparing them with his own homely shape. He
      would wonder what Old Mother Nature could have been thinking of when she
      made him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he didn't say so to her. No, indeed! He kept his thoughts to himself
      and never let his neighbors know that he envied them in the least. One day
      he wandered out from the Green Forest on to the Green Meadows. He liked it
      out there. He liked to look up and see so much of the blue, blue sky all
      at once. He liked to look off and see a long distance. Of course, he
      couldn't do that in the Green Forest because of the trees. He liked being
      by himself because he felt so sensitive about his homely shape. He
      discovered that if he lay down flat on his stomach when any one came near,
      he was always passed unnoticed. Being so broad and flat and altogether
      shapeless, he could remain unseen right out there on the open Green
      Meadows even when the grass was short, and that was something that Mr.
      Wolf and Mr. Fox and even little Mr. Rabbit couldn't do. It pleased him.
      He began to be less envious of his neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then one never-to-be-forgotten day the Red Terror, which men call fire,
      broke loose in the Green Forest, and all the little people fled before it.
      Across the meadows and past old Mr. Badger they raced, with fear in their
      eyes, and behind them came the Red Terror. A terrible fear sprang up in
      the heart of Mr. Badger. With those short legs he never in the world could
      run fast enough to escape. What should he do? What <i>could</i> he do? He
      looked at the great claws on his stout feet, and all in a flash an idea
      came to him. Perhaps if he dug a hole and crawled into it, the Red Terror
      would not find him. At once he began to dig, and how the dirt did fly! In
      just no time at all he was quite out of sight, and by the time the Red
      Terror had reached there, he was so far down in the ground that he didn't
      even feel the heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When it was all over and the earth had cooled off so that he could come
      out, he sat on the pile of dirt in front of his hole and did some hard
      thinking. He looked at his stout legs and long claws, and all at once it
      came over him that Old Mother Nature had not been so unfair after all. She
      had provided him with a means to take care of himself which he wouldn't
      exchange with any of his neighbors for all their speed and better looks.
      Later, when he saw how some of them were worn out with running, and some
      of them even had burned places on their coats, the last bit of envy
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I guess,' said he to himself, 'Old Mother Nature has given each one
      special blessings, but she expects us to find them out for ourselves. I've
      found mine out, some of them, anyway, and I'll just get busy and look for
      the rest. I'm going straight over to the prettiest part of the Green
      Meadows where the Red Terror hasn't been and dig myself a house in the
      ground. There is no place like a good home, so what is the good of roaming
      around? My legs were not intended for that, and those who have got longer
      legs can do it if they want to.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did just what he said he would do. He practised digging until he was
      the best digger of all the little people. The more he dug, the stouter and
      stronger his legs became, and soon he found that all his neighbors
      respected his strength, and none would quarrel with him. Because he could
      get plenty to eat near his home, he never went far from his doorstep, and
      from that time on he lived in perfect safety and contentment. He brought
      his children up to do the same thing, and if you should go over and ask
      Digger to-day, he would tell you that there is no place like home, and
      that he envies no one. I'm glad, however, that not every one agrees with
      him, or I should have hard work to get a living,&rdquo; concluded Old Man Coyote
      with a sly wink at Mrs. Peter.

      IX. WHEN BOB WHITE WON HIS NAME
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HIS isn't the
      story of the Bob White you know, and yet when I think it over, I don't
      know but that it is, after all. It is the story of the first Bob White,
      the great-great-great-ever-so-great-grand-father of the Bob White you know
      and I know and everybody who ever has heard his whistle knows. It is a
      story of that long-ago time, way back in the beginning of things, when the
      world was young, and yet I guess it is just as much our own Bob White's
      story as it is his great-great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather's. You see,
      it is because of it, of what happened in that long-ago time, that Bob
      White <i>is</i> Bob White. So that makes it his story too, doesn't it?
      Anyway, I'll tell you the story and leave it to you to decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Mother West Wind told me the story, and she got it from Peter Rabbit,
      and Peter got it from&mdash;well, I don't know for sure, but I suspect he
      got it from Bob White himself. You know Peter and Bob White are great
      friends. They are very near neighbors. They are such near neighbors and
      such good friends that if it popped into Peter's funny little head to be
      curious about Bob White's affairs, he wouldn't hesitate an instant to ask
      Bob about them. Anyway, some one told Peter the story, and I like to think
      that that some one was none other than that brown-coated little whistler,
      Bob White the Quail, himself. Here is the story as Old Mother West Wind
      told it to me:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long, long ago, way back in the beginning of things, when the world was
      young, when the Green Meadows were new, and the Green Forest was new, and
      the Smiling Pool and the Laughing Brook and the Big River were new, and
      the little and big people whom Old Mother Nature put in them to live were
      new too, being the very first each of his kind, things were different,
      quite different from what they are now. Old Mother Nature was busier than
      she is now, and goodness knows she is busy enough these days. In fact, she
      is a million times busier than the busiest other person in all the Great
      World. If she wasn't, if she grew tired or lazy or careless or anything
      like that, I am afraid things would go so wrong with the Great World that
      they never, never could be righted again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But in these far-away days in the beginning of things she was busier
      still. It is always easier to keep things going after they are once
      started than it is to start them, and Old Mother Nature was just starting
      things. So she started a great many of the little people off in life, and
      told them to make the best of things as they found them in the Great World
      and do as well as they could while she was attending to other matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now one of these little people was a plump little person in a coat of
      reddish-brown feathers. He was Mr. Quail, the
      great-great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather of all the Quails. To Mr.
      Quail, as to all the others, Old Mother Nature said: 'The Great World is
      new. There is a place in it for you, but you must find that place for
      yourself. There is work for you to do, but you must find out for yourself
      what it is. When you have real need of anything come to me, but don't
      bother me until you do have. No one who proves to be helpless or useless
      will live long. Now run along and prove whether or not you have a right to
      live.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So little Mr. Quail went out among the other people in the Great World to
      try and find his place. All the other people were trying to find their
      places, and some of them were having a dreadful time doing it. A great
      many began by trying to do just what their neighbors did, which was the
      very worst kind of a mistake. It was a pure waste of time. Worse still, it
      wasn't making a place in the work of the Great World. Little Mr. Quail's
      eyes were very bright, and he used them for all they were worth. His wits
      were quite as bright, and he used these the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'There are two things for me to find out,' said he to himself, 'what I
      can't do and what I can do. The sooner I find out what I can't do, the
      more time I'll have to find out what I can do. I've got wings, and that
      must mean that Old Mother Nature intends me to fly. I'm glad of that. It
      must be fine to sail around up in the air and see all that is going on
      down below.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up overhead Ol' Mistah Buzzard was sailing 'round and 'round, high up in
      the sky, with hardly a motion of his broad wings. Little Mr. Quail watched
      him a long time, and a great longing to do the same thing filled him. At
      last he sprang into the air, and right then he made a discovery. Yes, Sir,
      he made a discovery. He must beat his wings with all his might in order to
      stay in the air. When he stopped beating them and held them spread out as
      Ol' Mistah Buzzard did, he found that he simply sailed a little way
      straight ahead and then began to come down. He must keep those wings
      moving very fast or else come down to the ground. Then he made another
      discovery. In a very little while his wings were so tired that he just had
      to stop flying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Mr. Quail squatted in the grass and panted for breath. He was
      disappointed, terribly disappointed. 'It's plain to me that Old Mother
      Nature doesn't intend that I shall spend my time sailing about in the
      air,' said he. He scratched his pretty little head thoughtfully. 'I can
      fly pretty fast for a short distance,' he continued, talking to himself,
      'but that is all. That must mean that I have been given wings for use only
      in time of need. There are some birds flitting about in a tree. They seem
      to be having a good time. I think I'll join them. If I can't sail about in
      the air, the next best thing will be flitting about in the trees.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So after he had rested a bit, little Mr. Quail flew to the tree where the
      other birds were flitting about, and there he made another disappointing
      discovery. Try as he would, he couldn't flit about as they did. Moreover,
      he didn't feel comfortable perched in a tree for any length of time. It
      made his toes ache to bend them around the branch on which he was sitting.
      He watched the other birds, and his bright eyes soon discovered that their
      feet were different from his feet. Their toes were made to clutch twigs
      and hold them there comfortably, while his were not. 'Old Mother Nature
      doesn't intend that I shall spend my time flitting about in trees,' said
      he sorrowfully, and flew down to the ground once more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right away his feet felt better. All the ache left them. It was good to
      be on the ground. Pretty soon he began to run about. It was good to run
      about. He felt as if he could run all day without getting tired. While
      hunting for food he discovered that if his toes were not made for perching
      in trees, they certainly were made for scratching over leaves and loose
      earth where stray seeds were hiding. Then he made still another discovery.
      His coat was just the right color to make it hard work for others to see
      him when he squatted down close to the ground. If an enemy did discover
      him, his stout little wings took him out of danger like a bullet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little by little it came over him that he had found his place in the
      Great World, which was on the ground most of the time. But he remembered
      what Old Mother Nature had said about work to do, and this worried him a
      little. One day he watched Mr. Toad catching bugs. Old Mr. Toad was
      grumbling. 'I can't keep up with these pesky bugs,' said he. 'When I get
      my stomach full, I have to wait for it to get empty again before I can
      catch any more. But <i>they</i> don't wait. <i>They</i> keep right on
      eating all the time, and there won't be any green things left if I don't
      have help.'
    </p>
    <p>

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0153.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Mr. Quail grew thoughtful. Then he started in to help Old Mr. Toad
      catch bugs so as to give the green things a chance to grow. He had found
      work to do, and he did it with all his might. He forgot he ever had wanted
      to sail around in the air or flit about in the trees. He had found his
      place in the Great World, and he had found work to do, and also he had
      found the secret of the truest happiness. He was so happy that he had to
      tell his neighbors about it. So every morning, just before starting work,
      he would fly up on a stump and whistle with all his might; what he tried
      to say was, 'All-all's right! All-all's right!' But what his neighbors
      thought he said was, 'Bob-Bob White! Bob-Bob White!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So they promptly called him Bob White and loved him for the cheer which
      his clear whistle brought to them. When Old Mother Nature came to see how
      things were getting on, she found little Mr. Quail the happiest and the
      most useful of all the birds, and as she listened to his whistle, she
      smiled and said: 'I love you, Bob White, and all the world shall love
      you.' And all the world has loved him to this very day.&rdquo;

      X. WHEN TEENY-WEENY BECAME GRATEFUL
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ID something move
      among the dead leaves along that old log, or was it the wind that stirred
      them? Peter Rabbit stared very hard trying to find out. Not that it made
      the least bit of difference to Peter. It didn't. If something alive had
      moved those leaves, that something was too small for Peter to fear it.
      Probably it was a worm or a bug. It might have been a beetle. That looked
      like a good place for beetles. There was Jimmy Skunk ambling down the Lone
      Little Path this very minute, and Jimmy always appeared to be looking for
      beetles. Peter stared harder than ever. A leaf moved. Another turned
      fairly over. There wasn't any wind just then. Dead leaves don't turn over
      of themselves, so there must be something alive there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What has Peter on his mind this morning to make him stare so?&rdquo; asked
      Jimmy Skunk as he ambled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter grinned. &ldquo;I was just wondering,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if there are any fat
      beetles under that log over there. Those dead leaves along the side of it
      have a way of moving once in a while without cause that I can see. There!
      What did I tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, a couple of leaves had moved. Jimmy Skunk's eyes brightened.
      He actually almost hurried over to that old log, and began to rake away
      the leaves. Suddenly he stopped and sniffed. At the same time Peter
      thought he saw something dart in at the hollow end of that log. It might
      have been a shadow, but Peter had a feeling that it wasn't. Jimmy Skunk
      sniffed once more and then deliberately turned his back on that old log,
      and with his nose turned up, his face the very picture of disgust and
      disappointment, he rejoined Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Teeny Weeny, clever and spry,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Disappears while you wink an eye.'
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      said Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;Is that who it was? I suppose he was hunting
      beetles himself. He's such a little mite of a fellow that I should think a
      goodsized beetle could almost carry him away. I declare to goodness, I
      don't see how any one so small manages to live! Danny Meadow Mouse and
      Whitefoot the Wood Mouse are small enough, but they are giants compared
      with Teeny Weeny the Shrew. They have a hard enough time keeping alive,
      and I should think that any one smaller would stand no chance at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know Teeny Weeny very well?&rdquo; asked Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; confessed Peter. &ldquo;I've seen him only a few times and then had no
      more than a glimpse of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet he lives right around here where you come and go every day,&rdquo; said
      Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;I suppose it is because he is so small. He
      can hide under next to nothing.&rdquo; Jimmy grinned. &ldquo;I don't see but what
      you've answered yourself,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;It's because he is so small that
      Teeny Weeny manages to keep out of harm. He isn't very good eating,
      anyway, so I have heard say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? Because there isn't enough of him to make a bite?&rdquo; asked Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jimmy. &ldquo;Of course I don't know anything about it, but I've
      heard those who do say that a Shrew doesn't taste good, and that no one
      who is at all particular about his food will touch one. I am told that
      Hooty the Owl hunts Teeny Weeny, but Hooty isn't at all particular, you
      know. If Teeny Weeny tastes the way he smells, I for one don't want to try
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter laughed right out. He couldn't help it. The idea of Jimmy Skunk
      being fussy about smells was too funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; demanded Jimmy, suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the idea that any one so small can smell bad enough to make any
      difference,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;I wonder how he comes to have that bad
      smell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a reward,&rdquo; replied Jimmy. &ldquo;It's a reward handed down to him from the
      days when the world was young, and his
      great-great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather, the first Shrew, you know,
      who was also called Teeny Weeny, was given it by Old Mother Nature,
      because he had sense enough to be grateful and to tell her that he was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a story!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;It's a story, and you've just got to tell it
      to me, Jimmy Skunk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say please,&rdquo; grinned Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please, please, please, please,&rdquo; replied Peter. &ldquo;If that isn't enough,
      I'll say it as many times more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that will do, because after all it isn't so very much of a
      story,&rdquo; returned Jimmy, scratching his head as if he were trying to stir
      up his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It happened way back in the beginning of things that when Old Mother
      Nature had about finished making the birds and the animals, she had just a
      teeny weeny pinch of the stuff they were made of left over. Because she
      couldn't then and can't now bear to be wasteful, she started to make
      something. First she started to make it into a very tiny mouse. Then she
      changed her mind and started to make it into a tiny mole. Finally she
      changed her mind again and made it into something like each but not just
      like either, blew the breath of life into it, and set it free in the great
      world. That was Teeny Weeny, the first Shrew, and the smallest of all
      animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For a while Teeny Weeny wished that he hadn't been made at all. He wished
      that Old Mother Nature hadn't been so thrifty and saving. What was the
      good of being an animal at all if he wasn't big enough to be recognized as
      such? That's the way he felt about it for a while. It hurt his feelings to
      have old King Bear say, after just missing him with his great foot. 'I beg
      your pardon, You are so tiny I thought you were a bug of some kind. Of
      course, I don't mind stepping on bugs, but I wouldn't step on you for the
      world. Why don't you grow so that we can see you?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, why don't you?' asked old Mr. Wolf. 'If you get stepped on, don't
      blame us.' Even Mr. Meadow Mouse laughed at him because he was so small.
      Teeny Weeny was quite furious at that. So for a while he was very unhappy
      because he was so small. He ate and ate and ate, hoping that this would
      make him grow bigger. But it didn't. He remained as small as ever, the
      smallest of all the four-footed people. And his temper didn't improve. Not
      a bit. He was fretful and snappish. He said all sorts of things about Old
      Mother Nature because she had made him so small. He almost hated her. He
      couldn't see a single advantage in being so small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time went on, and at length came the hard times of which you have heard,
      the times when food was so scarce and most of the little people were
      always hungry. Then it was that the big and strong began to hunt the small
      and weak, as you know. At first Teeny Weeny was in a regular panic of
      fear. He felt that because he was so small he hadn't any chance at all.
      But after a while he made a discovery, a most amazing discovery. It quite
      took his breath away when he first realized it. It was that because he was
      so small he had more chance than some of those of whom he had been
      envious. Because he was so small, he could slip out of sight in a
      twinkling. He could slip into holes that no one else could get into. A
      leaf on the ground would hide him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he discovered that because he was so very small, it didn't take much
      food to fill his stomach, and he had no trouble in finding all he needed
      to eat. While his neighbors were going hungry, he was fat and comfortable.
      Bugs there were and worms there were in plenty, and on these he lived. One
      day he saw Old Mother Nature, and she looked worried. She <i>was</i>
      worried. It was in the very middle of the hard times and wherever she
      went, the little people of the Green Forest and the Green Meadows crowded
      about her to complain and ask her help. Teeny Weeny remembered all the
      bitter things he had said and all the bitter thoughts he had had because
      she had made him so small, and he was ashamed. Yes, Sir, he was ashamed.
      You see, he realized by this time that his small size was his greatest
      blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did Teeny Weeny do but march right straight up to Old Mother Nature
      the first chance he got and tell her how grateful he was for what she had
      done for him. He was quite honest. He told her how he had felt, and how he
      had said bitter things, and how sorry he was now that he understood how
      well off he was. Then he thanked her once more and turned to leave. Old
      Mother Nature called him back. She was wonderfully pleased to have these
      few words of thanks amid so many complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Teeny Weeny,' said she, 'because you have been smart enough to see, and
      honest enough to admit a blessing in what you had thought a hardship, and
      because you have been grateful instead of complaining, I herewith give you
      this musky odor, which will be distasteful to even the hungriest of your
      enemies. It is a further protection to you and your children and your
      children's children for ever and ever.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so it was, and so it has been, and so it is, and that's all,&rdquo;
       concluded Jimmy Skunk.

    <h2>
      XI. WHEN OLD MR. HARE BECAME A TURNCOAT
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>URNCOAT isn't
      considered a very nice name to call any one. You see, it is supposed to
      mean one who has turned traitor, as it were; has been on one side and gone
      over to the other side. If a soldier who is fighting for France should go
      over to the German army and fight for Germany against France, he would be
      a turncoat. Benedict Arnold, of whom you have read in history, was a
      turncoat. But the meaning isn't always bad. Just take the case of Jumper
      the Hare. In summer he wears a coat of brown, but in winter he wears a
      coat of white, the white of the pure driven snow. So you see he is a
      turncoat, but in his case it doesn't mean anything bad at all. On the
      contrary, it means something rather nice and very interesting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you know Jumper is the cousin of Peter Rabbit and looks very much like
      Peter, save that he is very much larger and has longer hind legs and
      longer ears. But Peter wears the same little homely brown coat in winter
      that he does in summer, the only difference being that it is thicker and
      so warmer. I am afraid that Peter has sometimes let a little envy creep
      into his heart when he has met his cousin wearing a coat of pure white. Be
      that as it may, Peter puzzled over the matter a great deal until he found
      out from Grandfather Frog how it happens that Jumper has such a lovely
      winter coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened one evening in early June, when Peter was hopping along down
      the Lone Little Path through the Green Forest, that he met Jumper and
      stopped to gossip for a few minutes. He had not seen Jumper since gentle
      Sister South. Wind had swept away the last of the winter snow. Then
      Jumper's coat had been white; now it was brown. This reminded Peter that
      he never had been able to tease Jumper into telling him how he could
      change his coat that way. None of Peter's other friends of the winter
      seemed to know, for he had asked all of them, and each had told him to ask
      Grandfather Frog. Of course, Peter couldn't do that in winter because
      Grandfather Frog was then fast asleep in the mud at the bottom of the
      Smiling Pool. With the coming of spring he had forgotten all about the
      matter. Now at the sight of Jumper once more, it all came back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Peter and Jumper parted, Peter started for the Smiling Pool,
      lip-perty-lipperty-lip. He arrived there quite out of breath. Grandfather
      Frog smiled a big, broad smile. Before Peter could say a word Grandfather
      Frog spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will catch a foolish green fly for me, Peter, Ill tell you the
      story,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a full minute Peter couldn't find his tongue, he was so surprised.
      &ldquo;How do you know what story I want?&rdquo; he stammered at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, but that doesn't make any difference,&rdquo; replied Grandfather
      Frog. &ldquo;Catch me a foolish green fly, and I'll tell you any story you
      want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;but I can't catch foolish green flies,&rdquo; cried Peter.
      &ldquo;I would if I could, but I can't, and you know I can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can try,&rdquo; replied Grandfather Frog gruffly, but with a twinkle in his
      eyes which Peter didn't see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter hesitated. Then suddenly he shut his lips in a way that meant that
      he had made up his mind to something. He looked this way and that way.
      Whichever way he looked he saw foolish green flies flitting about. He
      jumped for one and missed it. He jumped for another and missed it. It was
      the beginning of such a funny performance that Grandfather Frog nearly
      rolled off his big green lily-pad with laughter. Peter raced and jumped
      this way and that way on the banks of the Smiling Pool as if he had gone
      quite crazy, and at last in his excitement jumped right into the Smiling
      Pool itself after a foolish green fly. But not one did he catch.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he crawled out of the water, looking forlorn enough, Grandfather Frog
      took pity on him. &ldquo;Chug-a-rum!&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Lie down there in the sun and
      dry off, Peter, and I'll tell you the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I haven't caught you a foolish green fly!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but you've tried, and willingness to try is just as deserving of
      reward as successful effort. Now what was it you wanted to know?&rdquo; replied
      Grandfather Frog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you please, I want to know how it is that my cousin, Jumper the Hare,
      happens to have a white coat in winter. It seems to me very curious,&rdquo;
       replied Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long time ago, in the beginning of things,&rdquo; began Grandfather Frog,
      &ldquo;Old Mother Nature gave the first Hare a brown coat and turned him out
      into the Great World to shift for himself, just as she had done with all
      the other animals. That was a very easy matter for old Mr. Hare, who
      wasn't old then, of course. You see, those were good times with plenty for
      all to eat without trying to eat each other. Mr. Hare was very bashful,
      and like most bashful people he liked to be by himself. So he made his
      home in the most lonely part of the Green Forest and was very happy and
      contented for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now being alone so much made him very timid, ready to jump and run at the
      least unusual sound, and this, it happens, proved to be a very good thing
      for Mr. Hare. You see, being by himself that way, he had plenty to eat
      even after the hard times of which you have-heard had begun. So he was in
      splendid condition, was Mr. Hare, even after some of the other little
      people had begun to grow thin because of lack of food. One day Mr. Lynx
      happened to stray to that part of the Green Forest where Mr. Hare was
      living. He saw Mr. Hare before Mr. Hare saw him. He licked his lips
      hungrily. 'Ha!' thought he, 'this is where I get a good dinner.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With this he began to creep ever so softly towards Mr. Hare. But careful
      as he was, he stepped on a tiny stick and it snapped. Instantly away went
      Mr. Hare without stopping to see what had made the noise. That was because
      he had grown so timid from living so much alone. Then Mr. Lynx made a
      mistake. With a yell he started after Mr. Hare, and so Mr. Hare learned
      that it was no longer safe to trust his neighbors. Mr. Lynx didn't catch
      Mr. Hare, because Mr. Hare was too swift of foot for him, but he gave him
      such a scare was that Mr. Hare was more timid than ever.

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0181.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Others tried to catch him, and, little by little, Mr. Hare learned that
      he must always be on the watch, and that safety lay in two things&mdash;his
      long legs and his brown coat. He learned about the latter by being
      surprised once by Mr. Wolf. He knew that Mr. Wolf didn't see him as he
      crouched among the brown leaves. For once he was too frightened to run,
      Mr. Wolf was so close to him, and this, as it happened, was a very good
      thing. Mr. Wolf trotted right past without seeing him or smelling him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After that Mr. Hare tried that trick often, for he was smart, was Mr.
      Hare. When he suspected that he had been seen he ran, but when he felt
      sure that he hadn't been seen, he sat tight right where he happened to be.
      But when the first snow came, Mr. Hare found himself in a peck of trouble.
      He didn't dare sit still when an enemy was near, because his brown coat
      stood out so against the white snow, and when he ran it was an easy matter
      to keep him in sight. One day he was squatting under a snow-covered
      hemlock bough when he was startled by the howl of Mr. Wolf not far away.
      In his fright he jumped up, and the next thing he knew down came the snow
      from the bough all over him. Then, to his dismay, he saw Mr. Lynx not two
      jumps away. He sat still from force of habit. Mr. Lynx didn't see him; he
      went right past Presently Mr. Wolf came along, and he went right past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hare was puzzled. Then he just happened to glance at his coat. He was
      white with snow from head to foot! Then he understood, and a great idea
      popped into his head. If only he could have a brown coat in summer and a
      white coat in winter, he felt sure that he could take care of himself. He
      thought about it a great deal. Finally he screwed up his courage and went
      to Old Mother Nature. He told her all about how he had learned to sit
      tight when he wasn't seen, but that it didn't always succeed when there
      was snow on the ground. Then he told her how Mr. Lynx and Mr. Wolf had run
      right past him the time he was covered with snow. Very timidly he asked
      Old Mother Nature if she thought it possible that he might have a white
      coat in winter. Old Mother Nature said that she would think about it. It
      was almost the end of winter then, and he heard nothing from Old Mother
      Nature. With the coming of summer he quite forgot his request. But Old
      Mother Nature didn't. She kept an eye on Mr. Hare and she saw how timid he
      was and how he was in constant danger from his hungry neighbors. With the
      beginning of the next winter, Mr. Hare discovered one day that his coat
      was turning white. He watched it day by day and saw it grow whiter and
      whiter until it was as white as the snow itself. Then he knew that Old
      Mother Nature had not forgotten his request and at once hastened to thank
      her. And from that day to this, the Hares have had brown coats in summer
      and white coats in winter,&rdquo; concluded Grandfather Frog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, Grandfather Frog,&rdquo; cried Peter with a little sigh of
      contentment. &ldquo;I&mdash;I wish I could catch a foolish green fly for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take the will for the deed, Peter,&rdquo; replied Grandfather Frog. And he
      suddenly snapped up a foolish green fly that flew too near.

    <h2>
      XII. WHEN GREAT-GRANDFATHER SWIFT FIRST USED A CHIMNEY
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>F all his
      feathered friends and neighbors there was none whom Peter Rabbit enjoyed
      watching more than he did Sooty the Chimney Swift. There were two very
      good reasons why Peter enjoyed watching Sooty. In the first place Sooty
      always appeared to be having the very best of good times, and you know it
      is always a pleasure to watch any one having a good time. Ol' Mistah
      Buzzard, sailing and sailing high in the sky with only an occasional
      movement of his great wings, always seemed to be enjoying himself, and so
      did Skimmer the Swallow, skimming just above the tall grass of the Green
      Meadows or wheeling gracefully high in the air. But neither these two nor
      any other bird ever seemed to Peter to be getting so much real fun out of
      flying as Sooty the Swift. Just to hear him shout as he raced with swiftly
      beating wings and then glided in a short half circle was enough to make
      you want to fly yourself, thought Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second reason why Peter enjoyed watching Sooty was that he was very
      much a bird of mystery, in spite of the fact that Peter saw him every day
      through the long summer. You know, we all enjoy anything that is
      mysterious. To Peter there was no end of mystery about Sooty the Swift. He
      was not like other birds. In the first place he hardly looked like a bird
      at all. His tail was so short that it was hardly worth calling a tail. His
      neck was so short that his head seemed a part of his body. And then in all
      the time he had known him, Peter never had seen Sooty still for a single
      instant. Ol' Mistah Buzzard would come down from high up in the blue, blue
      sky and sit for hours on a dead tree in the Green Forest or walk about on
      the ground. Skimmer the Swallow would sit on the branch of a tree, or on
      the very top of Farmer Brown's barn, and twitter sociably. But Sooty the
      Swift was always in the air. At least, he always was whenever Peter saw
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes Peter used to wonder if Sooty slept in the air as Ducks sleep on
      the water. Of course, he didn't really think that he did, but never seeing
      him anywhere but in the air, he was ready to believe almost anything. Then
      one evening just at dusk, Peter happened to be over in the Old Orchard
      close by Farmer Brown's house, and he saw something that puzzled him more
      than ever. He saw Sooty the Swift right above the chimney on Farmer
      Brown's house. It seemed to Peter as if something happened to Sooty. He
      beat his wings in a queer way, but instead of flying on, he dropped right
      straight down, down, down, and disappeared. He had fallen down that
      chimney! Peter waited a long time, but Sooty didn't appear again, and
      finally Peter went home with the feeling that he never again would see
      Sooty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did see him again. He saw him the very next day, flying and
      shouting and seemingly having just as good a time as ever. It was then
      that Peter's curiosity would no longer be denied. He headed straight for
      the Smiling Pool to consult Grandfather Frog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll know all about Sooty if anybody does,&rdquo; thought Peter and hurried as
      fast as he could, lipperty-lipperty-lip. Grandfather Frog was in his usual
      place on his big green lily-pad. One glance told Peter that Grandfather
      Frog was in the best of humor, so he wasted no time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandfather Frog,&rdquo; cried Peter before he was fairly on the bank of the
      Smiling Pool, &ldquo;I saw something queer last night, and you are the only one
      I know of who can tell me what it meant, because you are the only one I
      know who knows all about everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grandfather Frog smiled. It was a great, big, broad smile. It pleased him
      to have Peter say that he knew everything. &ldquo;Chug-a-rum! Not everything,
      Peter! I don't know everything. Nobody does,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But if I happen to
      know what you want, to know, I'll be glad to tell you. Now what is it that
      is on your mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter at once plunged into his story. He told Grandfather Frog how much he
      enjoyed watching Sooty fly and how little he knew about Sooty. He wound up
      by telling how he had seen Sooty fall down that chimney and how surprised
      he had been to see Sooty about the next day as well and happy as ever. He
      called Sooty a Swallow, for that is what Peter thought that Sooty was. He
      always had thought so.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Peter had finished, Grandfather Frog chuckled. It was a long, deep
      chuckle that seemed to come clear from his toes. When he had enjoyed his
      chuckle to his heart's content, he looked up at Peter and blinked his
      great goggly eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you say, Peter, if I should tell you that Sooty isn't a member
      of the Swallow family at all?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd believe you,&rdquo; replied Peter promptly, &ldquo;but I never again would dare
      guess what family anybody belonged to from his looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Sooty isn't a Swallow at all,&rdquo; said Grandfather Frog slowly. &ldquo;He is
      a Swift, which is another family altogether. Furthermore, he didn't fall
      down that chimney. No, Sir, he didn't fall down that chimney. He flew
      down, and he did it because he lives there. Now listen, and I'll tell you
      a story.&rdquo; Peter needed no second invitation. A story from Grandfather Frog
      is always one of Peter's greatest treats, as you know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chug-a-rum!&rdquo; began Grandfather Frog, as he always does. &ldquo;When Old Mother
      Nature first peopled the Great World, she made each bird a little
      different from every other bird, and each animal a little different from
      every other animal. Then she turned them loose to make their way the best
      they could, and let them alone to test them and see how each would make
      the best of his advantages. Mr. Swift, the
      great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather of Sooty, felt at first as if Old
      Mother Nature had forgotten to give him any advantages at all. He was
      homely. There wasn't so much as a single bright feather in his whole coat.
      He had a tail which might as well have been no tail at all, so far as he
      could see. He had tiny feet on which he couldn't walk at all, and with
      which it was all he could do to hang on to a twig when he wanted to rest.
      But when it came to wings, he wasn't long in discovering that in these he
      was blessed beyond most of his neighbors. Those wings certainly were made
      for speed. They were long and narrow, and they drove him through the air
      faster than his neighbors with broader wings could fly and with a great
      deal less effort. He could fly all day without getting tired, and he never
      was so happy as when darting about high in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, it didn't take him long to find out that he could catch all
      kinds of flying insects, and so he had no trouble in filling his stomach
      while flying, for his mouth was very wide. 'It must be,' thought he, 'that
      Old Mother Nature expects me to live in the air. I wish I could sleep
      while I am flying, but I can't. I never feel comfortable sitting on a
      twig.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day he discovered that he could do something that no other bird could
      do. By using his wings in a certain way he could drop right straight down
      without really falling. He practised this a great deal just for fun. Then
      one day as he was flying over a rocky place, he saw right under him a
      great hole that went straight down into the ground. It interested him. He
      wondered what it was like inside. The more he wondered, the more he wanted
      to find out. So one day, after many trials, he dropped straight down into
      the hole by means of that new way of flying he had discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't go very far down, because it was so dark in there, and he was
      beginning to get a wee bit frightened. On his way up he brushed against
      the side of the rocky wall and without knowing why, he put out both feet
      and clung to it, folding his wings for a minute's rest. Then he found that
      by pressing his funny little tail, which ended in sharp spines, against
      the wall, he rested more comfortably than ever he had before in all his
      short life. He could cling to a rough wall very much easier than he could
      sit on a perch. After that he spent his nights in that hole and was happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A long time later he was far from home when night was coming on, and he
      knew that he wouldn't be able to get there before dark. Looking down as he
      flew, he saw the hollow trunk of a great tree which had been broken off by
      the wind. Why not sleep in that? He circled over it two or three times and
      then dropped straight down inside. He liked it. He liked it better than he
      did the hole in the rocks. After that he made his home in a hollow tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In course of time old King Eagle led the birds to a new part of the Great
      World which Old Mother Nature had been preparing for them to spend the
      summer in. Mr. Swift went with the others. But when he got there, he could
      find no hole in the ground and no hollow tree. But he found something
      else. He found the queer homes of men and on top of each a straight, tall
      thing quite like a hollow tree, only all black inside and made of what
      seemed like stone. Having no other place to go, he tried one of them. The
      next day he searched for a hollow tree but could find none, and so
      returned to that chimney, for that is what it was. So it was every day.
      After a little he began to like the chimney. It was easy to get in and out
      of. No one ever bothered him there. It was easy to cling to the wall of
      it. At last he decided to build a nest there. And from that day to this,
      the Swifts have lived in the chimneys on the houses of men. When you
      thought you saw Sooty fall, he was simply going home to spend the night,&rdquo;
       concluded Grandfather Frog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied Peter with a long sigh. &ldquo;It's a funny world, isn't
      it, Grandfather Frog? The idea of living in a chimney! The very idea!&rdquo;

      XIII. WHEN PETER RABBIT FIRST MET BLUFFER THE ADDER
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>OPPITY-SKIP down
      the Crooked Little Path, lipper-ty-lipperty-lip, went Peter Rabbit in his
      usual heedless, careless way. Peter never can seem to get it into his
      funny little head why he should be careful when there appears to be no
      particular reason for being careful. He is like a great many people&mdash;careful
      when he knows that there is danger near, but as heedless as you please
      when he thinks that all is safe. He has got to see or hear danger before
      he will believe that it is near. Like a lot of other folks he has yet to
      wake up to the fact that the only way to keep out of trouble is to be
      always prepared for trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Peter hopped and skipped down the Crooked Little Path, as he had a
      thousand times before, without a thought of danger. Nothing ever had
      happened to him on the Crooked Little Path, and so he thought nothing ever
      could. Suddenly as he rounded a little turn, there was a sound that made
      Peter stop so suddenly that he almost fell over backward&mdash;a sound
      that made every hair on his body stand on end and his eyes pop out with
      fright. It was a hiss, the loudest, most awful hiss he ever had heard. For
      just a second Peter was too frightened to move. There, coiled up right in
      the Crooked Little Path, was a member of the Snake family whom he never
      had seen before. And such a fierce, ugly-looking fellow as he was! No
      wonder Peter was frightened. This Snake had the flattest head Peter ever
      had seen. His body was rather short and thick, and his neck was flattened
      in a way that made it appear very large and gave to him a very ugly and
      dangerous look.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as he could get his wits together, Peter turned and raced
      pell-mell up the Crooked Little Path as fast as his long legs would take
      him. Looking behind him he didn't see in front of him, and so he almost
      ran into Jimmy Skunk. In fact, he would have, if Jimmy hadn't cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, there! Why don't you look where you are going? What is the matter
      with you, anyway, Peter Rabbit?&rdquo; Peter was so startled by Jimmy that he
      jumped to one side as if he suddenly had stepped on something hot. Then he
      saw who it was. &ldquo;Oh, Jimmy,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you mustn't go down the Crooked
      Little Path!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; demanded Jimmy Skunk, staring at Peter and noting how
      frightened Peter was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; panted Peter, &ldquo;right down there in the middle of it is one of
      Mr. Black Snake's cousins, and I know by his looks that he is one of the
      dangerous kind, like Buzztail the Rattler. Ugh! I nearly ran into him, and
      he hissed enough to make your hair rise. He's got a terrible temper. I
      wouldn't go near him again for the world. Where are you going, Jimmy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down the Crooked Little Path to have a look at this terrible fellow,&rdquo;
       replied Jimmy over his shoulder. &ldquo;Perhaps I can teach him some manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jimmy, do be careful!&rdquo; begged Peter. &ldquo;He really is very terrible. I
      know his bite must be awful. I guess it is worse than that of Buzztail the
      Rattler. I wouldn't go if I were you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not such a fraidy as you, Peter,&rdquo; replied Jimmy Skunk, and ambled on
      down the Crooked Little Path. Peter wasn't sure about it, but he thought
      he heard Jimmy chuckle. That settled matters for Peter. If Jimmy was
      laughing at him for warning him of danger, he could just go on and get a
      good fright. It would serve him right. Peter hesitated a minute, then at a
      safe distance he followed. He wanted to see Jimmy Skunk when he rounded
      that little turn in the Crooked Little Path and heard that terrible hiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy ambled along slowly, for you know he never hurries. Presently he
      disappeared around that little turn, and right away Peter heard that
      terrible hiss. He expected to see Jimmy come racing back, and he was all
      ready to make fun of him for pretending to be so brave. But Jimmy didn't
      come. Once more Peter beard that angry hiss and felt his hair rise on end.
      Then all was still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter waited as long as he could stand it, and then his curiosity got the
      best of him. Slowly and carefully be tiptoed along until he could see
      around the turn in the Crooked Little Path. What he saw quite took his
      breath away. There sat Jimmy Skunk looking down at something stretched out
      at his feet. It was that dreadful Snake on his back, and he appeared to be
      quite dead. Jimmy reached out and poked him, but Mr. Snake didn't move.
      Jimmy poked him some more, and still he didn't move.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0211.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jimmy, however did you dare to try to kill him?&rdquo; cried Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy looked back at Peter and grinned. &ldquo;Come on with me, and I will tell
      you a story,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter hesitated, but the thought of a story was too much for him, and he
      followed Jimmy down the Crooked Little Path, taking pains to go around the
      body of Mr. Snake and not very near it at that, although he knew it was
      silly and foolish to be afraid of one who was dead. Jimmy didn't go far.
      He sat down and waited for Peter to join him. From where they were they
      could see the body of Mr. Snake stretched out on its back in the Crooked
      Little Path. Somehow, now that he was dead, Mr. Snake didn't look so very
      fierce and terrible. In fact he didn't look nearly so big as he had when
      he was alive. Peter was thinking of this when his heart gave a funny
      little jump. He had turned his head for just a second and now, as he
      looked back at Mr. Snake, he felt that his eyes must be playing him tricks
      for Mr. Snake was on his <i>stomach</i> instead of on his <i>back!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter opened his mouth to say something, but Jimmy made a sign to keep
      still. So Peter kept still and with popping eyes watched Mr. Snake.
      Presently he saw Mr. Snake's head come up a little at a time and then move
      from side to side as if Mr. Snake were looking to see that the way was
      clear. Slowly Mr. Snake began to glide forward. Then, as if satisfied that
      no one was watching, he moved faster as if in a hurry to get away from
      there, and in a moment he disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter gulped two or three times as if trying to swallow the truth and then
      turned to stare at Jimmy Skunk. Jimmy laughed right out because Peter
      looked so funny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you didn't kill him, after all,&rdquo; gasped Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Jimmy, &ldquo;I didn't even touch him until you saw me poke him
      when he lay there on his back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter looked quite as puzzled as he felt. &ldquo;Was he just pretending to be
      dead the way Unc' Billy Possum does?&rdquo; demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmy nodded. &ldquo;You've guessed it,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why did he do it?&rdquo; persisted Peter, such a puzzled look on his face
      that Jimmy just had to laugh again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he was afraid and tried to fool me into thinking him dead so that
      I would leave him alone,&rdquo; replied Jimmy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid! That fellow afraid!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter in an unbelieving tone of
      voice. &ldquo;Why, when I saw him first, he was the most savage,
      dangerous-looking fellow that ever I have met.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once more Jimmy laughed. &ldquo;All in his looks, Peter,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Yes, Sir,
      all his fierceness is in his looks. Really he is one of the most harmless
      and gentle fellows in the world. He tried to scare me just as he
      frightened you, and when he found it wouldn't work, he tried the other
      plan&mdash;pretended that he was dead. No one but Old Mr. Toad has the
      least reason in the world to be afraid of him. All his fierceness is just
      pretending, and that is how he comes by his name, which is Bluffer the
      Puff-Adder. I'm surprised that you've never happened to meet him before. I
      believe some folks call him the Hog-nosed Snake. I always like to meet him
      just to see him try to scare me, and when he finds he can't, I do a little
      pretending myself and give him a little scare by pretending that I am
      going to fight him. Then he always rolls over on his back and pretends
      that he is dead. I suppose he is chuckling to himself now because he
      thinks that he fooled us. The next time you meet him just show him that
      you know he is perfectly harmless and see how quickly he'll stop
      pretending that he is so ugly and dangerous. He learned that trick of
      bluffing from his father, and his father learned it from his father, and
      so on way back to the days when the world was young. I would tell you the
      story now if I had time, but I haven't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll have to do it some other time,&rdquo; retorted Peter, &ldquo;for I shall
      give you no peace until you do.&rdquo;
     </p>

      XIV. WHEN MR. WOOD MOUSE LEARNED FROM THE BIRDS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ETER RABBIT never
      will forget the first time that he saw Whitefoot the Wood Mouse pop out of
      a nest in a bush a few feet above his head. It wasn't so much the surprise
      of seeing Whitefoot as it was the discovery that that nest was
      White-foot's own. Peter, had seen that nest often. It was in a bush just a
      little above one of Peter's favorite paths on the edge of the Green
      Forest. Always he had supposed that it belonged to one of his feathered
      friends. He had seen many such nests. At least, he supposed he had. That
      was because he hadn't taken the trouble to look at this one particularly.
      He hadn't used his eyes. If he had, he might have seen that this, while
      very like other nests he had seen, was different. It was different in that
      it had a roof. Yes, Sir, this particular nest had a roof. And it had a
      doorway, a very small doorway, and this doorway was underneath, a very
      queer place for a bird to make a doorway had there been any bird of his
      acquaintance who would build a roof to a nest, anyway. All of which goes
      to show how easy it is to see things without really seeing them at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just at dusk that Peter happened along this particular little path
      and saw Whitefoot the Wood Mouse pop out of that nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;What are you doing up there? What business have
      you in that nest? Have you been stealing eggs?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I haven't been stealing eggs,&rdquo; retorted Whitefoot indignantly. &ldquo;And
      if I haven't any business in this nest I should like to know who has. It's
      my nest! Who has a better right in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your nest!&rdquo; exclaimed Peter. &ldquo;Why, I thought you lived in a hollow tree
      or a hollow log or a hole in the ground or some such place. How long is it
      since you learned to build a nest like a bird, and who taught you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whitefoot knew by the tone of Peter's voice that Peter didn't believe a
      word of what he had been told. He looked very hard at Peter, and in his
      big, soft, black eyes was an indignant look which Peter couldn't help but
      see. &ldquo;I don't care whether you believe it or not, this is my nest, and I
      built it,&rdquo; said he indignantly. &ldquo;At least I built it over,&rdquo; he added, for
      Whitefoot is very truthful. &ldquo;In the winter I do live in a hollow tree or a
      hollow log or a hole in the ground, whichever is most comfortable, but in
      the warm weather I have a summer home, and this is it. My family has known
      how to build such homes ever since the days of my
      great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather when the world was young. It was he
      who learned the secret, and it has been in our family ever since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter's long ears stood straight up with excited interest and curiosity.
      &ldquo;Tell me about it!&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;Tell me how your
      great-great-ever-so-great-grandfather learned how to build a nest like a
      bird. Please tell me, White-foot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whitefoot sat up and daintily washed his pretty white hands. &ldquo;I don't
      think I will,&rdquo; he replied slowly. &ldquo;You didn't believe me when I said that
      this nest is mine, and so I'm sure you won't believe the story of my
      great-grandfather. I don't like telling stories to people who don't
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I will believe it!&rdquo; cried Peter. &ldquo;If you say it is true, I'll believe
      every word of it. Please tell me the story, Whitefoot. Oh, please do.&rdquo;
       Peter was very much in earnest. &ldquo;I'm sorry I didn't believe you at first
      when you said that this nest is yours. But I do now, Whitefoot. I do now.
      Please, please tell me the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Whitefoot's black eyes snapped and twinkled. He enjoyed being teased for
      that story. You see, he is such a little fellow, such a very little
      fellow, that his bigger neighbors seldom take any notice of him unless it
      is to try to catch him. There are several who would be glad to swallow
      Whitefoot if they could catch him. So, being such a little fellow, he felt
      rather puffed up, rather important, you know, that Peter Rabbit should be
      so interested and should actually be begging him for a story. He climbed
      up to a crotch in a tree just a little above Peter's head, a place where
      he could watch out for danger, made himself comfortable with his back
      against the trunk of the tree, carefully combed his fur, for Whitefoot is
      very particular how he looks, and then began his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always, ever since the world was young, Mice have been among the smallest
      of the little people of the Green Meadows and the Green Forest, and
      because of this they have had to live by their wits if they would live at
      all. In the beginning of things it was not so, I have heard it said,
      because then there was plenty for all to eat and no cause for the big and
      strong to seek to kill the small and weak. But when the hard times came
      and hunger led to the doing of many dreadful things, all of the Mouse
      tribe found that they were in danger all the time, just as they are
      to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My great-great-great-grandfather, the first of all the Wood Mice, chose
      the Green Forest for his home instead of the Green Meadows where his
      cousin, old Mr. Meadow Mouse, liked best to live. He chose the Green
      Forest because it was always beautiful there, and because among the roots
      of the trees and in the trees themselves there were so many hiding-places.
      He was very small, just as I am, and he was very smart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just as you are?&rdquo; inquired Peter with a twinkle in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't say that!&rdquo; retorted Whitefoot indignantly. &ldquo;I never have claimed
      to be very smart, though I've been smart enough to keep out of the
      clutches of Reddy Fox and Hooty the Owl and all the others who hunt me.
      But great-great-great-grandfather <i>was</i> smart. In the Green Forest he
      had prepared for himself many hiding-places. Some were in the ground, some
      were in holes in trees, and some were in hollow stumps and logs. For a
      while he felt quite safe and easy in his mind, even when the times had
      become so hard and food so scarce that night and day some of his big
      neighbors like Mr. Lynx and Mr. Fox and Mr. Wolf and Mr. Owl and Mr. Hawk
      and even old King Bear were sure to come prowling about looking for little
      people like himself. You see, he had plenty to eat himself because he had
      been forehanded and had stored away seeds in some of his hiding-places.
      And he felt perfectly safe because the doorways to his hiding-places were
      so very small that none of these people could follow him into them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he used to laugh at those who hunted him and sometimes would dodge
      into one of his little doorways right under their very noses. But one day
      he saw old King Bear tear open an old hollow stump with his great claws,
      and he knew that King Bear was looking for him. Another day quite by
      chance he happened to see Mr. Weasel slip into one of his smallest
      doorways, and then a great fear took hold of Grandfather Wood Mouse. His
      enemies knew now where to look for him and how to get into his
      hiding-places; they were no longer safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I must find a new hiding-place and keep it a secret,' thought he. For
      many days he went about, thinking and thinking. One day he had this very
      much on his mind as he watched Mr. Catbird build a nest. All in a flash a
      great idea came to him. If he could have a home in a bush like that of Mr.
      Catbird, no one ever, ever would think of looking for him there! 'If birds
      can build nests, why can't I?' thought he. All that day he watched the
      building of Mr. Catbird's nest, trying to see just how each stick was
      placed and how the nest was lined with fine roots and grass and strips of
      grapevine bark. The next day he hunted up some old nests in bushes not too
      high above the ground and climbed up to them. He even pulled some of them
      to pieces to see how they were made and then tried to put them together
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I believe I can do it!' he exclaimed over and over to himself. 'I
      believe I can do it! Any way, it will do no harm to try. No harm can come
      of trying.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He remembered an old nest in a bramble bush not far from where he lived.
      This he examined very carefully. It would do for a foundation. Then he
      went to work, taking care to build only when no one was near to discover
      his secret. He brought grass and fine roots, and he made that nest more
      comfortable than it had been when it was first built. Then he built a roof
      over it, so that it would shelter him in bad weather, and to get into it
      he made a little round doorway. When it was finished, he was very proud of
      it, as he had reason to be. He carried seeds into it, and then he made it
      his home for the summer and way into the fall. Of course, no one ever
      dreamed of looking for him in what seemed like a bird's nest, and many a
      time he peeped out and watched his hungry neighbors walk right under him
      without ever suspecting that he was near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, he taught his children the secret of nest-building which he
      had learned from the birds, and that has been the most precious secret in
      our family ever since. You won't tell any one, will you, Peter?&rdquo; he
      concluded anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Peter, &ldquo;I won't tell any one. Of course I won't. It must be
      nice to have a sort of sky-parlor in the summer,&rdquo; he added wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Whitefoot. &ldquo;I just love my summer home.&rdquo; With this he
      climbed up to his snug nest, and the last Peter saw of him was his long
      slim tail disappearing through the little round doorway.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>ETER RABBIT didn't
      intend that for any ears but his own, but it never is safe to talk out
      loud if you want no one else to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said a voice right back of Peter. Peter started ever so little and
      hastily turned his head, but saw no one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; said the voice again. &ldquo;Huh! Are you a poet, Peter Rabbit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time Peter turned wholly around in a single jump. Staring up at him
      from under a mullein-leaf was Old Mr. Toad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's a poet?&rdquo; demanded Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A poet is some one who&mdash;who&mdash;Say, Peter Rabbit, have you eaten
      something that went to your head?&rdquo; Old Mr. Toad looked really anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Peter, &ldquo;it went to my stomach. Everything I eat goes to my
      stomach.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then it can't be that you are a real poet,&rdquo; sighed Old Mr. Toad. &ldquo;I was a
      little afraid you might be when I overheard you just now. On the whole I
      am rather glad, Peter. It would be so tiresome to have to listen to you
      talking that way. By the way, who is it that is not there and is not here,
      yet no one saw him disappear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hummer the Hummingbird,&rdquo; replied Peter eagerly. &ldquo;You see him in one place
      and before you can get your mouth open to speak, he is somewhere else.
      Then in a shake of your tail he isn't anywhere at all. I mean he isn't
      anywhere in sight.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't any tail,&rdquo; retorted Old Mr. Toad rather testily. &ldquo;I got rid of
      the silly thing long ago, as you very well know, Peter Rabbit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Toad. I didn't mean anything personal. It was just a way
      of speaking to show how quickly Hummer disappears. I was thinking of my
      own tail,&rdquo; said Peter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; grunted Old Mr. Toad just as before. &ldquo;Then you weren't thinking of
      much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Peter laughed. &ldquo;Not so very much,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Still I can shake it, even
      if there isn't much of it. See!&rdquo; He stood up and twitched his funny little
      tail until solemn Old Mr. Toad had to laugh in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hummer is such a wonderful little fellow,&rdquo; continued Peter eagerly. &ldquo;He
      is so tiny it doesn't seem possible that he can be like other birds. I
      don't feel really acquainted with him because he isn't still long enough
      for me to more than nod to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's true,&rdquo; replied Old Mr. Toad, nodding sagely. &ldquo;He isn't still down
      near the ground, but if you happened to find his home, you would often see
      him sitting near it as still as any other bird. By the way, Peter, did you
      ever hear how it happened that he comes by such a long bill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A story!&rdquo; cried Peter, jumping up and down and clapping his hands. &ldquo;Oh,
      Mr. Toad, I never did hear, and I'm just dying to know. Please do tell
      me!&rdquo; There was a twinkle in Old Mr. Toad's beautiful eyes,&mdash;for they
      really are beautiful, you know. He backed a little farther under the big
      mullein-leaf where the sun couldn't reach him, opened and closed his big
      mouth two or three times without making a sound, rolled his eyes back as
      if he were looking way, way into the past, and then, just as Peter had
      begun to think that there wasn't going to be any story after all, he began
      to talk in a funny little voice that seemed to come from way down where
      his throat and his stomach meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was long, long, long ago,&rdquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know! It was way back when the world was young,&rdquo; interrupted Peter
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! So you know the story after all, do you?&rdquo; grunted Old Mr. Toad rather
      crossly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon. I do indeed. I'm sorry,&rdquo; Peter hastened to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Very well,&rdquo; grumbled Old Mr. Toad, &ldquo;but don't do it again. Now
      I'll have to begin all over again. It was a long, long, long time ago in
      the beginning of things when Old Mother Nature had made all the big birds
      and the middle-sized birds and the little birds that she discovered that
      she had just a teeny, weeny bit of the things birds are made of left over.
      There wasn't enough to make even the head of an ordinary bird. No bird had
      use for another head, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Old Mother Nature never could bear to waste anything, and she didn't
      intend to begin. So she made a teeny, weeny bird and she made him just as
      perfect as any other bird. She gave him feathers just like any other bird,
      only of course his feathers were teeny, weeny. She gave him a tail just
      like any other bird, only it was a teeny, weeny tail. She gave him feet
      with toes and claws just like any other bird, only they were teeny, weeny
      feet. And she gave him a bill, only it was a teeny, weeny bill and it was
      short. And because he was so teeny, weeny and yet a perfect bird, Old
      Mother Nature was very proud of him, so she gave him a beautiful green
      coat. The beautiful ruby throat was not given him until later, when he
      proved so brave of heart and so loyal to King Eagle, you remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; said Peter. &ldquo;He got his ruby throat when old King Eagle won
      his crown of white.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When Old Mother Nature sent little Mr. Hummingbird out into the Great
      World to join the other birds, she told him that tiny as he was she could
      treat him no differently from the others, and that he would have to take
      care of himself and prove that he was worthy to live and have a place in
      the work of the Great World, for that was a law which she could not break
      for any one, great or small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So little Mr. Hummingbird darted away to join the other birds and find a
      place for himself in the Great World. When the other birds first saw him,
      they laughed at him because he was so tiny, and made fun of him. though
      truth to tell some of them were envious because of his beautiful coat, and
      others were envious because of the way in which he could dart about, for
      not one among them could fly so swiftly as little Mr. Hummingbird.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0008.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tiny though he was, he was stout of heart and fairly bursting with spunk.
      He would dash into the very faces of those who tried to tease him and
      would be away again before they could so much as strike at him. So it
      wasn't long before they let him alone, though among themselves they still
      looked on him as a joke and were sure he would not live long. Being such a
      teeny, weeny fellow, of course Mr. Hummingbird had a teeny, weeny stomach,
      and he soon discovered that he couldn't eat the things that other birds
      did but must hunt for teeny, weeny things. It didn't take him long to find
      out that there were many teeny, weeny insects just suited to him,
      especially about the flowers. So Mr. Hummingbird spent most of his time
      darting about among the flowers catching teeny, weeny insects to fill his
      teeny, weeny stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day he paused in front of a deep-throated flower and discovered that
      many teeny, weeny insects had hidden in the heart of it. Try as he would
      he could not reach them. Now his own swift little wings were not quicker
      than Mr. Hummingbird's temper, and he promptly pulled that flower to
      pieces. Then he caught all the insects, and in doing this he discovered
      that in the heart of the flower were sweet juices, better than anything he
      ever had tasted before. After that he wasted no time hunting for teeny,
      weeny insects in the air, but darted from one deep-throated flower to
      another, pulling them to pieces and filling his teeny, weeny stomach with
      the insects hiding there and the sweet juices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One day along came Old Mother Nature to see how things were going. On
      every side were beautiful flowers torn to rags. She threw up her hands in
      dismay. 'Dear me!' she cried. 'I wonder who can have been doing such
      dreadful mischief!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just then she caught sight of little Mr. Hummingbird tearing another
      flower to pieces. Sternly she called him before her, and he came
      fearlessly. 'Why are you tearing my beautiful flowers to pieces?' she
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Because it is the only way I can get the food in the hearts of them, and
      it is the food best suited to me,' replied little Mr. Hummingbird promptly
      but respectfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Mother Nature tried to look severe, but a twinkle crept into her
      eyes. Secretly she was pleased with the fearlessness of the teeny, weeny
      bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That may be, but I cannot have my beautiful flowers destroyed this way.
      It will never do at all!' said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She scratched her head thoughtfully for a few minutes. Then she reached
      out and took hold of Mr. Hummingbird's teeny, weeny bill. 'Pull,' said
      she. Little Mr. Hummingbird pulled with all his might, and his bill was
      pulled out until it was long and slender, and his tongue was pulled out
      long with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Now,' said Old Mother Nature, 'I guess you won't have to pull my flowers
      to pieces.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little Mr. Hummingbird darted away to the nearest deep-throated flower
      and found that he could reach the teeny, weeny insects and the sweet
      juices without the least trouble, and from that time on he took the
      greatest care not to hurt the beautiful flowers. That is how Hummer, whom
      you know, happens to have a long bill,&rdquo; concluded Old Mr. Toad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose that is why he seems to love the flowers so,&rdquo; said Peter as
      he looked down at Old Mr. Toad thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied Old Mr. Toad, and yawned sleepily.

      XVI. WHEN OLD MR. BAT GOT HIS WINGS
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T happens that the
      Merry Little Breezes, who, as you know, are the children of Old Mother
      West Wind, are quite as fond of stories as is Peter Rabbit. In fact,
      whenever they suspect that Peter is going to ask some one for a story,
      they manage to be about so that they may hear it too. Now the Merry Little
      Breezes are very fond of Grandfather Frog and many, many times they have
      helped him get a good dinner by blowing foolish green flies within his
      reach. It was after one of these times that Grandfather Frog promised them
      a story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Merry Little Breezes did not intend to let Grandfather Frog forget
      that promise, so one afternoon when they had grown tired of romping on the
      Green Meadows, they danced over to the Smiling Pool and settled around the
      big, green lily-pad on which Grandfather Frog was dozing. All together
      they shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;We know you're old;
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      We know you're wise;
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And what you say
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      We dearly prize.
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      So tell a tale
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Of olden days,
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      And then, mayhap,
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      We'll go our ways.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Chug-a-rum! What shall it be about?&rdquo; demanded Grandfather Frog, waking up
      quite good-natured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell us why Flitter the Bat can fly when none of the other animals can,&rdquo;
       cried one of the Merry Little Breezes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandfather Frog cleared his throat several times, and then he began, and
      this is the story he told:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once upon a time when the world was young, old Mr. Bat, the many times
      great-grandfather of Flitter, whom you all know, lived in a cave on the
      edge of the Green Forest. Old Mr. Bat was little, quite as little as
      Flitter is now. He didn't have any wings then. No, Sir, old Mr. Bat had no
      wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now old Mr. Bat's teeth were small and not made for cracking hard seeds
      and things of that sort, so he lived mostly on insects. He used to hunt
      for them under sticks and stones. Sometimes he had hard work to find
      enough for a meal, because, you know, so many other Green Forest people
      were hunting for them too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now old Mr. Bat's eyes were very small, very, very small indeed, and the
      bright sun hurt them. So old Mr. Bat used to stay in his cave all day and
      hunt for his meals only after jolly Mr. Sun had gone to bed behind the
      Purple Hills. When he did come out most of the crawling bugs had been
      caught by others, and it was hard work finding them. So often Mr. Bat went
      hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One evening old Mr. Bat noticed that at twilight a great many bugs fly
      about. He sat on a big stone at the mouth of his cave and watched. It
      seemed to him that the air was full of bugs. By and by a big fat fellow
      came so near that old Mr. Bat forgot where he was and jumped for him&mdash;jumped
      right off: the top of the big stone. Of course he got a hard tumble, but
      he didn't mind it a bit, not a bit, for he had caught the bug. After that,
      old Mr. Bat used to spend most of the time he was awake jumping for flying
      bugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One night he made a very long jump from a <i>very</i> high stone and got
      such a fall that all the breath was knocked out of his funny little body.
      When he had gotten his breath back he discovered that some one was looking
      down and smiling at him. It was Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Pretty hard work to get a dinner that way, isn't it, Mr. Bat?' asked Old
      Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bat allowed that it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'How would you like to fly!' asked Old Mother Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Bat thought that that would be very fine indeed, but that was quite
      out of the question because, as you know, he hadn't any wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old Mother Nature said no more, but something seemed to be pleasing her
      greatly as she left Mr. Bat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next evening when old Mr. Bat awoke, he really didn't know whether he
      was himself or not. No, Sir, he didn't. His legs were much longer than
      they used to be and really of no use at all for walking. Between them was
      a queer thin skin. He couldn't run. He couldn't even crawl very well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At last, after much work, he managed to get to the top of a big rock. He
      was very hungry, and when a big, fat bug came along, he forgot all about
      his troubles and tried to jump. But instead of jumping as he always had,
      he just tumbled off the big rock. As he fell he spread out his legs. What
      do you think happened? Why, old Mr. Bat found that he could fly!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And ever since that long-ago time the Bats have lived in dark caves and
      have been able to fly,&rdquo; concluded Grandfather Frog.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo; cried the Merry Little Breezes. &ldquo;And we thank you ever and
      ever so much!&rdquo; Then they had a race to see who could be the first to blow
      a foolish green fly over to Grandfather Frog.
    </p>
